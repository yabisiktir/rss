February’s tipple of choice is port – whether bold, bright ruby or caramel-hued tawny. Surely the perfect antidote to the most miserable of months?</strong></p><p>I probably said this last year, but February is my nemesis. By now, the relentless dark, cold dampness of Dutch winter is so ingrained that it’s hard to remember what spring even feels like. My bank balance has still not recovered from the festive season, and just when things couldn’t get any bleaker the annual tax bill arrives from the <em>gemeente</em>. There’s only one way to get through it: hunker down indoors with good food, good wine and good friends.</p><p>My top tip for you this February is port: it’s sweet and boozy enough to feel warming on even the coldest of days. And it demands only simple food that requires the minimum of effort: a cheese board, perhaps some charcuterie or nuts, with dried fruit and dark chocolate to finish. A perfect wintry evening at home.</p><p><strong>Before we pour: a few port basics</strong></p><p>All port comes from the Douro Valley in northern Portugal, which is searingly hot in summer and bitterly cold in winter (I can attest to this, having witnessed the mercury moving from -1 to 29 degrees Celsius in less than a week in early April). To be more precise, the grapes are grown in the Douro Valley, where the winemaking process also takes place. But while today many producers also age their wines in the Douro itself, traditionally port was matured closer to the coast in Porto (or Vila Nova de Gaia) to benefit from cooling Atlantic breezes.</p><p>Most ports use key Portuguese red grape varieties like Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca, Tinta Roriz (which is Tempranillo in Spain), Tinta Barroca and Tinta Cão, but dozens more are permitted – Portugal is home to an unholy number of native varieties.</p><p>The grapes are pressed, crushed and fermented just like a red wine – but the fermentation is stopped after a day or so when only part of the sugars have converted to alcohol, leaving a lot of residual sugar in the wine. At that point, a high-proof grape spirit known as <em>aguardente</em> is added, which fortifies the wine to the 19-20% alcohol levels you generally find in port.</p><p>If we leave aside white and rosé ports for now, there are two main families of port:</p><ol><li><strong>Ruby-based styles</strong> that tend to be fruit-focused and undergo minimal oxidisation; and</li><li><strong>Tawny-based styles</strong> that undergo oxidative ageing to produce paler wines with nutty, caramel flavours.</li></ol><p>Within those two families, there are lots of sub-categories – some of which we’ll come back to when we get into this month’s recommendations. But from a port newbie perspective, it’s useful to try both styles to see which you prefer.</p><p>Whatever your port preference, you’re likely to come across a few big names everywhere you look: Dow’s, Taylor’s, Graham’s, Croft – some or all of these might ring a bell. But there are hundreds of other lesser-known port producers, many of which offer better value or a more interesting end product. That’s why I’ve chosen to focus on some slightly more off-the-beaten-path port producers in my picks.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-263025" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_263025" style="width: 560px"><noscript><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-263025" decoding="async" height="373" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Port-line-up_Photo-Vicky-Hampton-560x373.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Port-line-up_Photo-Vicky-Hampton-560x373.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Port-line-up_Photo-Vicky-Hampton-1200x800.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Port-line-up_Photo-Vicky-Hampton-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Port-line-up_Photo-Vicky-Hampton-768x512.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Port-line-up_Photo-Vicky-Hampton-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Port-line-up_Photo-Vicky-Hampton-2048x1366.jpg 2048w" width="560"/></noscript><img alt="" class="lazyload size-medium wp-image-263025" data-sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" data-src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Port-line-up_Photo-Vicky-Hampton-560x373.jpg" data-srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Port-line-up_Photo-Vicky-Hampton-560x373.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Port-line-up_Photo-Vicky-Hampton-1200x800.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Port-line-up_Photo-Vicky-Hampton-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Port-line-up_Photo-Vicky-Hampton-768x512.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Port-line-up_Photo-Vicky-Hampton-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Port-line-up_Photo-Vicky-Hampton-2048x1366.jpg 2048w" decoding="async" height="373" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20560%20373%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="560"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-263025">This month’s top picks. Photo: Vicky Hampton</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Best budget bottle:</strong> <strong>Quevedo Ruby (€9.29 from </strong><a href="https://www.jumbo.com/producten/quevedo-ruby-porto-750ml-66112FLS"><strong>Jumbo</strong></a><strong>, supermarkets nationwide)</strong></p><p>If you’re looking to spend under €10 a bottle, a simple, entry-level ruby port is the best place to start. Quevedo’s Ruby is minimally aged in large, stainless steel tanks, keeping the fruit profile fresh and youthful. The result is bright, vibrant and plummy – nothing complex, but a sweetly fruity, reliably easy-drinking port at a wallet-friendly price. Drink this lightly chilled by itself, or pair that sweetness with something salty and savoury like <em>prosciutto</em> or <em>jamón</em>.</p><p><strong>Magnificent mid-range: Morgadia da Calçada Ruby Reserve (€17.95 from </strong><a href="https://www.bosmanwijnkopers.nl/en/morgadio-da-calcada-ruby-reserve-port.html"><strong>Bosman Wijnkopers</strong></a><strong>, The Hague)</strong></p><p>I’ve made quite a leap this month from budget to mid-range, but I really think it’s worth the extra €8 if you can afford it. In comparison with the first port above, Ruby Reserve spends longer ageing in large vats, allowing it to gain complexity while still avoiding oxidation. Producers also use a more selective blend of higher-quality base wines, resulting in deeper fruit, more structure and a smoother, more refined style than standard ruby.</p><p>Morgadia da Calçada’s Ruby Reserve is rich and spicy, structured and elegant: deep black cherry meets chilli-spiked dark chocolate (which, incidentally, would make a great pairing with this port). It’s a significant step-up from basic supermarket ports, and this particular Ruby Reserve was so good it could almost pass for an LBV.</p><p><strong>Special ruby: Quinta do Vallado LBV 2019 (€24.95 from </strong><a href="https://www.bosmanwijnkopers.nl/en/late-bottled-vintage-port.html"><strong>Bosman Wijnkopers</strong></a><strong>, The Hague)</strong></p><p>LBV stands for Late Bottled Vintage, and it tends to be my go-to when I’m looking for a special ruby port. All the grapes come from a single vintage, and the port spends 4+ years ageing in large oak vats before being bottled ready for release. It’s more approachable (not to mention more affordable) than Vintage Port, and it makes a fantastic accompaniment to a cheese board.</p><p>My LBV pick comes from Quinta do Vallado – one of the oldest estates in the Douro Valley. Its aromas are highly concentrated, featuring dried fruit like prunes and figs, as well as the sweet smoke of tobacco. On the palate, you’ll find some firm, red-wine-like tannins, which are probably what makes this LBV such a great match for cheese.</p><p><strong>Special tawny: Quinta da Pedra Alta 10-year Tawny (€28.99 from </strong><a href="https://www.grapedistrict.nl/en/quinta-da-pedra-alta-no10-tawny-port"><strong>Grapedistrict</strong></a><strong>, stores nationwide)</strong></p><p>Don’t be fooled by cheap tawny ports: their colour comes from blending paler wines, not from oxidative ageing per se. It’s only when tawnies have spent 10 or more years ageing in small oak barrels (known as pipes) that you really start to see that characteristic amber colour and nutty caramel flavours. And the longer the ageing process, the more intense the effect (if you ever get the opportunity to taste a tawny that’s 40 years old, take it – provided someone else is paying!).</p><p>Quinta da Pedra Alta’s Tawny is aged for 10 years in oak, making it still relatively young and fresh in tawny terms, but already showing some oxidative character. Think walnuts and coffee, dates and figs, and a luscious butterscotch finish. All the elements of a delicious dessert wine.</p><p><em>For more of Vicky’s wine recommendations and grape explorations, follow </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/trufflesandtannins/"><em>@TrufflesandTannins</em></a><em> on Instagram or subscribe to </em><a href="https://trufflesandtannins.substack.com/"><em>The Wine Edit on Substack</em></a></p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" href="/life-in-the-netherlands/food-drink/"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/wine/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=263021</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 08:15:45 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Vicky Hampton]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Dutch women cricketers qualify for first ever T20 World Cup</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/02/dutch-women-cricketers-qualify-for-first-ever-t20-world-cup/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-263016 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-cricket-2 category-sport"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Dutch women cricketers qualify for first ever T20 World Cup</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-02-02T08:08:37+00:00"> February 2, 2026 </time> <a class="me-2" href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/author/malhar-hathi/" rel="author"> Malhar Hathi </a></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-263018" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_263018"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="800" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/DSC01247-1.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/DSC01247-1.jpg 1000w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/DSC01247-1-560x448.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/DSC01247-1-768x614.jpg 768w" width="1000"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-263018"> The Dutch women celebrate their qualification.

We saw the puddles on the covers and were like, ‘Let’s go!’”</p><p>Apart from De Leede, who lives in Cape Town and plays for Western Province, and batter Sterre Kalis, who is contracted with Yorkshire, none of the players are full-time professionals.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>“I think that makes it even better,” De Leede said.</p><p>“Most of the girls have to work besides training, and they have to study. It’s very challenging to combine everything and also to maintain some sort of social life. We have put in a lot of hard work and made a lot of sacrifices. So it’s even more special for us, especially competing against teams here that do have contracted players.”</p><p>Despite suffering losses against Ireland and Bangladesh to round out the tournament, it was a perfect send-off for outgoing head coach Neil McRae, who took charge of the side in January 2024 and will now take up the role of Jersey’s director of cricket.</p><p>The Dutch had warmed up with an encouraging third-place finish at the eight-team ICC Emerging Nations Trophy in Bangkok in November though winter training at home proved challenging.</p><h2>Training</h2><p>Alongside McRae, it was all hands on deck with the men’s team’s coaches Ryan Cook, Ryan van Niekerk and Heino Kuhn putting the side through their paces.</p><p>“We were training in zero degrees and warming up with our cricket gloves on,” De Leede said.</p><p>“We obviously couldn’t train on turf pitches, and we couldn’t do any fielding, which was a bit of a limitation. Since we trained a lot over Christmas, not everyone was available so we had boyfriends, dads, brothers to help us out and throw at us as we don’t have any left-arm seamers or spinners. It was quite special.”</p><h2>June event</h2><p>The Netherlands will join hosts England, defending champions New Zealand, India, Pakistan, South Africa, Australia, Sri Lanka, West Indies, Bangladesh, Ireland and Scotland for the showpiece event in June.</p><p>“Before qualifying, we wanted to stay grounded and not talk about the World Cup too much but now, we are dreaming of playing at Lord’s or playing against Australia or India or England,” De Leede said.</p><p>“We want to actually compete and keep improving the way we have been and cause some serious upsets at the World Cup.”</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/cricket-2/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/sport/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=263016</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 08:08:37 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Malhar Hathi]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>PSV punish Feyenoord errors to take 17-point lead in Eredivisie</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/02/psv-punish-feyenoord-errors-to-take-17-point-lead-in-eredivisie/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-263008 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-eredivisie category-football category-sport"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> PSV punish Feyenoord errors to take 17-point lead in Eredivisie</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-02-01T19:59:50+00:00"> February 1, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-263009" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_263009"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="1706" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ANP-549335480-scaled.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ANP-549335480-scaled.jpg 2560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ANP-549335480-560x373.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ANP-549335480-1200x800.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ANP-549335480-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ANP-549335480-768x512.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ANP-549335480-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ANP-549335480-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" width="2560"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-263009"> Ismael Saibari (r) celebrates after scoring PSV's third goal after just 17 minutes.

the gas after that, although only a flying save by Wellenreuther stopped Saibari adding a fourth after half an hour.</p><p>Feyenoord finished the match with 10 men when Goncalo Borges received a

League with defeat at Bayern Munich in midweek.</p><p>Feyenoord coach Robin van Persie dismissed questions about his future, but said he took responsibility for the team’s disappointing

The chips are down for managers at ASML as the company announces 1,700 layoffs despite posting record profits. New commemorative panels at Margraten war cemetery only partly dispel the anger over the erasure of the Black Liberators, just as Donald Trump’s crass outburst raises the hackles of Dutch Nato soldiers. The Netherlands is told to do more to protect Bonaire from climate change. And Dutch clubs round off a calamitous Champions League season with a pair of home defeats.</p><p><iframe frameborder="no" height="300" scrolling="no"

Let us pool our strengths in and outside parliament, with social organisations, industry and everyone living here.”</p><p data-end="579" data-start="466">The tasks ahead are major he said, “but the Netherlands became a great country through collaboration.

It also plans to charge football clubs when police are needed to ensure public safety at matches.</p><p data-end="781" data-start="599">Everyone will be asked to pay a “freedom contribution” via income tax, ultimately raising more than €3 billion a year, and the healthcare own-risk charge will rise from €385 to €460.</p><p data-end="954" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="" data-start="783">The new administration also plans to introduce major cost-cutting measures in healthcare and social security, including cutting unemployment benefit from two years to one.
