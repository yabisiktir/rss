Here’s a recap of this year’s Dutch destinations – our recommendations for a short break, including what to do and where to stay.</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/11/dutch-destinations-a-weekend-in-edam-monnickendam-and-marken/">A weekend in Edam, Monnickendam and Marken</a><br/> The pretty villages of Edam, Monnickendam and Marken are well worth a visit at any time of year. A weekend in this part of Noord-Holland will give you a whole lot of history, picture-perfect vistas, and interesting little shops and museums to poke around in whatever the season.</p><p><a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/09/dutch-destinations-take-in-the-allure-of-apeldoorn/">Take in the allure of Apeldoorn</a><br/> For many travellers, Apeldoorn serves as a gateway to the Veluwe area of wild heathland. Have a stopover here while on your way to the wilderness and visit its modern art museum, cafes, and of course, a royal palace.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p><a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/08/dutch-destinations-zip-over-to-zwolle-for-a-longer-stay/">Zip over to Zwolle for a longer stay</a><br/> The often overlooked capital of Overijssel has a colourful history and it is well worth a day trip or a longer stay. You can easily pass a few hours or longer in the Museum de Fundatie before checking out what else the city has to offer in its historic centre, which is surrounded on all sides by a ring of canals.</p><p><a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/07/dutch-destinations-warmond-the-hidden-gem/">Warmond, the hidden gem</a><br/> The Netherlands is full of charming villages that rarely make it into travel guides, places that remain quiet treasures known only to the locals and few other lucky ones. Situated on the banks of the Kagerplassen lake system, Warmond is surrounded by water, greenery, colourful flowers in spring and it features a beautiful country estate that reminds of times gone by.</p><p><a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/05/dutch-destinations-venture-back-into-the-veluwe/">Venture back into the Veluwe</a><br/> Wilderness is a rarity in the Netherlands. This rambling stretch of heathland and forests in Gelderland is about as close as it gets to wide open spaces in this corner of the world. Explore the Veluwe’s trails or visit one the many quaint towns along its edges.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p><a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/03/dutch-destinations-uitwaaien-on-the-wadden-island-of-vlieland/">Uitwaaien on the Wadden island of Vlieland</a><br/> Looking for a quick getaway and to take in some sea air without a long journey or too many other people with the same idea?

But if you’re looking for a way to get fit, up your social life and hang out with some <em>echte </em>Dutchies, then joining a sports club may be the only resolution you need. </strong></p><p>“Every time I move I find a sports club,” says 47-year-old energy executive and lifelong athlete Michelle Lesh. “It’s the quickest way to build community.”</p><p>Originally from the US, the college volleyball player found rowing as an adult. These days you can find her giving lessons on the Amstel River at <a href="https://karzvdehoop.nl/">De Hoop boat club</a> in Amsterdam Oost, one of the country’s oldest.</p><p>“You’re with people week in and week out and build trust and connection so much faster,” says Lesh, who admits to speaking “rowing” Dutch. “You see the cultural similarities. Rowing is rowing. The words may be different, but the sport is the same.”</p><p>Lesh, who moved from Switzerland to Amsterdam in 2021, says rowing has helped her build a strong people network, make business connections and even integrate into Dutch society, including learning how to navigate the Dutch healthcare system.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>“The sports element is common, but sitting with a coffee later is a way to make deeper connections,” she says. “You get access to knowledge with people who want to help you because you’re part of a team.”</p><p>She notes that in Switzerland and the Netherlands, adults are encouraged to join sports clubs, as compared to the US, where you have to seek them out. “It’s normal here, it’s more social,” she says. “You’re kind of expected to stay for a coffee. It’s a more holistic experience.”</p><p>One of her first-time rowing students, Brazilian Jefferson Gomes (33), agrees. “I decided to join the rowing club because I wanted to pick up a sport and feel more integrated into the community. It turned out to be a great decision — I’ve learned a few Dutch words (even if they’re mostly rowing-related!) and met some really nice people.”</p><p>He especially enjoys summer rowing on the Amstel, the many club-organised events and the opportunity to volunteer at races and competitions, “which makes the whole experience even more enjoyable.”</p><h2><strong>Volunteering</strong></h2><p>Volunteering is a big part of sports club life in the Netherlands, especially for smaller organisations that have fewer members and resources than some of the bigger field hockey and football clubs.</p><p>It’s something that parents quickly discover when they sign up their offspring for one of the many Amsterdam hockey or football clubs. Bar shifts and driving to away games are very much part of the job.</p><p>Unlike in many countries, competitive sports for children are arranged around clubs not schools, and they are a place where youngsters often make friends for life.</p><p>Dutch brand and design consultant Theo Lindemann (62) is a cricket player and board member at <a href="https://www.vra.nl/en">VRA Cricket Amsterdam</a>, the country’s largest cricket club. A teenage baseball player, he became fascinated by cricket, but there was none of it in the east of the country when he was growing up. A Dutch friend brought him into VRA 35 years ago, and he hasn’t looked back.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261263" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_261263" style="width: 560px"><noscript><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-261263" decoding="async" height="374" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-560x374.jpeg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-560x374.jpeg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-1200x800.jpeg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-360x240.jpeg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-768x512.jpeg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w" width="560"/></noscript><img alt="" class="lazyload size-medium wp-image-261263" data-sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" data-src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-560x374.jpeg" data-srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-560x374.jpeg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-1200x800.jpeg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-360x240.jpeg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-768x512.jpeg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w" decoding="async" height="374" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20560%20374%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="560"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-261263">VRA Cricket Amsterdam.

They’ve travelled the world together playing cricket – from Cape Town to Goa to Philadelphia – while here in Amsterdam, they make sure the substantial number of transient international club members feel at home.</p><p>But with only some 450 club members, as compared to 2,500 for a big field hockey organisation, everyone is expected to do their part. And at VRA Amsterdam, a large part of that centres around the clubhouse, which serves as a socialising spot to meet people outside of work and family.</p><p>“The bigger clubs can afford to hire a professional hospitality worker, but the small clubs can’t do that,” he says. Everyone pitches in behind the bar and also helps prepare the grass pitches and take care of the practice nets.</p><p>“The city helps with the maintenance of the fields,” he says, “but we own the pavilion and must maintain it. It’s all volunteers.” After they bought the clubhouse in 2019, a lot of people who couldn’t get to the office because of COVID had time on their hands to help renovate the building at a time when construction work was still allowed. “We needed all the volunteers we could get,” he says. “And we got them.”</p><h2>Beer and <em>bitterballen</em></h2><p>Fellow cricket VRA club member Prasun Bannerjee (45) moved to Amsterdam from Calcutta in 2017 as a highly skilled migrant. He’s one of the club members—some 50% of them—who hail from India or Pakistan.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>“In India, cricket is a religion,” says the systems engineer who dreamed of pursuing cricket as a career when he was young. He applauds the cricket infrastructure in the Netherlands, which helped him meet people and integrate while playing a sport he loved.</p><p>“The social part is very interesting to me,” he says. “A game, some beer, a few <em>bitterballen</em> and a chat. In India, that’s only at the experienced level.”</p><p>While Bannerjee plays competitive cricket, which is all about the sport, he also enjoys the social league, where people come to enjoy the game and camaraderie but don’t get competitively crazy.</p><p>“You get to meet locals and others in the cricket diaspora, which is a mix of ages, skill levels and demographics,” he says. “Especially in the summer, when there are barbeques and dinners and drinks. That’s how friendships develop.”</p><p>Now that it’s winter, club members still train together, play padel and often meet for dinner and game nights at someone’s home. He urges newcomers to join social cricket, which he says is unique to the Netherlands.</p><p>“Our cricket team plays poker during the winter,” he says. “I’m now getting hooked on poker!”</p><h2>Don’t give up!</h2><p>But sometimes finding a sports club can be difficult, says Cathy Leung (52), executive producer of Bram Radio and the Broadcast Amsterdam foundation. The London native moved to Amsterdam 15 years ago with her Dutch husband. She actually met him on a hockey pitch while playing on a corporate club in Britain. Once they moved to the Netherlands, finding a proper hockey club was her priority.</p><p>“I found it difficult to locate one,” she says, “which is surprising because there are so many clubs here. But a lot of people play. It’s a bit who you know here.”</p><p>Leung says not speaking Dutch also hampered her. She bounced around a few hockey clubs trying to find a good fit, and enjoyed playing on Ernst &amp; Young’s corporate club, but, after the birth of her daughter, she traded in her hockey stick for a tennis racquet.</p><p>At the <a href="https://www.tennisclubkattenlaan.nl/">T.C. Kattenlaan</a> tennis club in the Vondelpark, Leung started organising teams and became a captain. She eventually joined the club’s policy-setting committee, which meant her Dutch was up to par.</p><h2>Stand up for yourself</h2><p>“I was forced to speak Dutch, which is right,” she says. “It’s very integrating, learning the rules and settling arguments in Dutch. I’ve made connections and learned how to stand up for myself and not be a passive player.”</p><p>Her advice to those who are club searching in the city? “Don’t give up! There are lots of different clubs,” she says. “Finding and getting onto the right team is challenging. But get a taste of different clubs to get an idea of their culture.”</p><p>For tennis, you can do that via a membership of the <a href="https://www.knltb.nl/">KNLTB</a> tennis association, the umbrella organization for tennis, padel and pickleball in the Netherlands.</p><p>Leung herself has actually found her way back to hockey via tennis through a teammate who invited her to her club. “Sometimes it’s knowing people who open doors,” says Leung. “I went on a ski vacation with my new hockey team. Between tennis and hockey, I have two very strong social networks.”</p><p><em>From baseball to ice hockey, lacrosse to rugby, padel to badminton. Amsterdam has hundreds of team sports clubs.

Self-reliance and resilience are vital, he said, but they cannot exist without community.</p><p data-end="1572" data-start="1435">“Things don’t work without a community in which people look out for one another, listen to one another and support one another,” he said.</p><p data-end="1584" data-start="1574"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1890" data-start="1586">The king spoke at length about parenthood and raising children. Although his daughters are now grown up, he said he still vividly remembered holding a newborn child. “Everything becomes relative, except that tiny being in your arms,” he said. “You want to protect them from all harm and make them happy.”</p><p data-end="2059" data-start="1892">“Children step out into the wider world, and parental love alone cannot protect them from everything,” he said. “You cannot always shield them from pain or misfortune.</p><p data-end="2253" data-start="2061">“So let us do our best to ensure that our world remains a liveable place, where no one stands alone and where the strong have an eye for those who are vulnerable, afraid, lonely or uncertain.”</p><p data-end="2505" data-start="2255">The king finished by referring to the Biblical Christmas story which, he said, “brings us back to the basics. We can all relate to it: a newborn child, a new beginning for us all. The future is open. The light returns. The shortest day is behind us.”</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/royals/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/society/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=261532</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 12:34:19 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Fewer Dutch are opting for supplementary health cover</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/12/fewer-dutch-are-opting-for-supplementary-health-cover/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-261521 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-accidents category-healthcare category-insurance category-travel"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Fewer Dutch are opting for supplementary health cover</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2025-12-24T07:52:35+00:00"> December 24, 2025 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-125051" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_125051"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="667" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/broken-leg-hospital-injury.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/broken-leg-hospital-injury.jpg 1000w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/broken-leg-hospital-injury-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/broken-leg-hospital-injury-560x374.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/broken-leg-hospital-injury-768x512.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/broken-leg-hospital-injury-300x200.jpg 300w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/broken-leg-hospital-injury-100x67.jpg 100w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/broken-leg-hospital-injury-130x87.jpg 130w" width="1000"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-125051"> Photo: Depositphotos.com</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><div class="relative basis-auto flex-col -mb-(--composer-overlap-px) [--composer-overlap-px:28px] grow flex"><div class="flex flex-col text-sm pb-25"><article class="text-token-text-primary w-full focus:outline-none [--shadow-height:45px] has-data-writing-block:pointer-events-none has-data-writing-block:-mt-(--shadow-height) has-data-writing-block:pt-(--shadow-height) [&amp;:has([data-writing-block])&gt;*]:pointer-events-auto scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]" data-scroll-anchor="true" data-testid="conversation-turn-10" data-turn="assistant" data-turn-id="request-WEB:ee4d653c-bbcb-4cc8-9aa8-d9eb2b0fbb40-19" dir="auto" tabindex="-1"><div class="text-base my-auto mx-auto pb-10 [--thread-content-margin:--spacing(4)] @w-sm/main:[--thread-content-margin:--spacing(6)] @w-lg/main:[--thread-content-margin:--spacing(16)] px-(--thread-content-margin)"><div class="[--thread-content-max-width:40rem] @w-lg/main:[--thread-content-max-width:48rem] mx-auto max-w-(--thread-content-max-width) flex-1 group/turn-messages focus-visible:outline-hidden relative flex w-full min-w-0 flex-col agent-turn" tabindex="-1"><div class="flex max-w-full flex-col grow"><div class="min-h-8 text-message relative flex w-full flex-col items-end gap-2 text-start break-words whitespace-normal [.text-message+&amp;]:mt-1" data-message-author-role="assistant" data-message-id="66f0b945-7c3d-41e1-a6c7-bda16a9c8c8a" data-message-model-slug="gpt-5-2" dir="auto"><div class="flex w-full flex-col gap-1 empty:hidden first:pt-[1px]"><div class="markdown prose dark:prose-invert w-full break-words light markdown-new-styling"><p data-end="266" data-start="80">An increasing number of people in the Netherlands are dropping their supplementary health insurance, according to research by comparison website Zorgwijzer.</p><p data-end="556" data-start="268">The figures show just three in five policyholders have opted for additional cover during the current season to switch insurance, down from 72% last year.

He has made <a href="https://www.heritage.org/europe/commentary/western-civilization-can-only-be-saved-if-the-eu-abolished">similar comments multiple times</a>, saying on the Heritage Center website earlier this month that “the transatlantic alliance will be far better off when the EU is consigned to the dustbin of history.”</p><p data-end="1203" data-start="861">Gardiner’s remarks follow increasingly sharp criticism of the EU from Washington. In February, US vice-president JD Vance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_JD_Vance_speech_at_the_Munich_Security_Conference">publicly attacked Europe</a>, while a new <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/12/08/europeans-stunned-and-challenged-by-new-us-security-strategy_6748270_4.html">US national security strategy</a> published earlier this month warns that Europe risks “losing its civilisation through immigration and the erosion of national identities”.</p><p data-end="1379" data-start="1205">The document praises nationalist parties seeking to preserve national character and history, and explicitly backs “patriotic parties” working to dismantle the EU from within.</p><p data-end="1681" data-start="1381">Germany’s chancellor Friedrich Merz has described the US stance as “unacceptable and indefensible”. Eurocommissioner for human rights Michael O’Flaherty urged European leaders to show courage in the face of American criticism.</p><p data-end="1681" data-start="1381"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1681" data-start="1381">Caretaker Dutch prime minister Dick Schoof did not comment publicly but Dutch far right politicians have said they supported the document.</p><p data-end="1887" data-start="1683">Gardiner told Nieuwsuur the EU wields too much power over member states and suppresses freedom of expression. He pointed to fines totalling €120 million imposed by the European Commission on social media platform X, owned by Elon Musk, saying such measures amounted to “attacks on American tech companies” that undermine US security.</p><p data-end="2910" data-start="2697">He also accused the EU of sidelining the will of voters, curbing the influence of radical right parties such as Germany’s AfD, and opening the door to mass migration. “All of this means the EU is doomed,” he said.</p><p data-end="2934" data-start="2912">Gardiner also warned that EU ambitions to develop a stronger defence role clash with US interests. “That undermines Nato by diverting military resources,” he said. “Nato will hopefully exist for centuries. The EU will not.”</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/dutch-european-news/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/foreign-affairs/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/nato/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/us/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=261498</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 07:19:40 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item></channel></rss>
