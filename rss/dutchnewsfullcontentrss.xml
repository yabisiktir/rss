That means the real number of vacancies is much higher,” Nationale Vacaturebank director Sharita Boon said.</p><p>The site does not keep a record of how many of the vacancies are being filled, Boon said but more than one employer is looking for youngsters with an MBO trade school diploma in a tight labour market.</p><p>Candidates must also be willing to undergo military training. “Cooks and mechanics may be called on to fight if necessary.

To keep those guys under control for 15 overs was sensational, I thought.</p><p>“Maybe a couple of missed chances, maybe a little bit of mis-execution and players like them will make you pay.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>“We knew we had to take wickets throughout. [India being] four down at 16 [overs], they obviously had wickets in hand there and obviously, took down a few overs at the end.”</p><p>De Leede echoed his sentiments: “It’s obviously a ground with a shorter side to the one side so boundaries were definitely gettable and I fully believed that we could have chased this down.”</p><p>The Dutch team suffered from the lack of a genuine power hitter, or two, in their lower-middle order. Needing 76 off the last 30 balls, similar to what India managed, they could only manage 59.</p><h2>Off-spin in powerplay</h2><p>Against India’s left-hand dominated batting lineup, with as many as six in their top eight, Scott Edwards used the obvious matchup, bowling four overs of off-spin in the powerplay.</p><p>Dutt extended Abhishek Sharma’s run drought – the number one ranked T20I batter is yet to get off the mark after three innings – and also accounted for Ishan Kishan, India’s leading run-scorer at the tournament.</p><p>He should have added Dube to his wicket tally if not for the umpire’s call to deny him a leg before wicket.</p><p>The Dutch seamers took pace off the ball on a slow black soil pitch to keep a check on the run-rate, never allowing it to creep up beyond eight an over until the final overs.</p><h2>Openers struggled</h2><p>In response, the openers, Max O’Dowd and Michael Levitt were wary against the new ball and struggled for rhythm, eventually being dismissed two overs apart.</p><p>De Leede and Colin Ackermann stitched a crucial 43-run partnership as the duo looked to accelerate. Dutt was elevated to number 5, walking out before Edwards, in a bid to take down the Indian spinners but fell first ball to Chakravarthy, who walked away with figures of 3-14.</p><p>Several batters started well but failed to convert them into a substantial score. Zach Lion-Cachet (26 off 16) and Noah Croes (25 not out off 12), the latter on his World Cup debut, matched Edwards with a reverse lap and sweeps and kept the Dutch in the hunt briefly with a flurry of inventive boundaries, but fell short, with 28 runs needed off the last over.</p><p>The men’s squad will reconvene in April for the start of the domestic season and a preparatory camp ahead of their next Cricket World Cup League 2 games against the US and hosts Canada in May.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/cricket-2/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/sport/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=263823</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 07:37:35 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Malhar Hathi]]></dc:creator></item></channel></rss>
