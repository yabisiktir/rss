The PVV’s votes are needed to pass the law in the senate.</p><p>But in a committee debate on Monday, PVV MP Marina Vondeling said the party was prepared to drop the ban on helping refugees because it was more important to crack down on illegal residency.</p><p>Van Weel has argued that making it a crime for people to stay in the Netherlands after they have been refused asylum would make it easier to repatriate them, but experts have disputed the claim.</p><p>Last week legal experts told parliament that it would not change the situation of people who want to go back but are not accepted by their countries of origin.</p><p>The Hague‘s police chief, Karin Krukkert, said it risked creating a revolving-door scenario because refugees who are jailed for living in the country would be immediately committing another offence as soon as they were released from prison.</p><p>“In that case, prison will not solve the crime,” she said.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden
