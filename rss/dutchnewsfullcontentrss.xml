His comments, made at a business event shortly after the results came in, prompted strong criticism from her party as well as from JA21 and the PVV.</p><p data-end="828" data-start="587">Wijers said on Thursday that he regretted the remark and had apologised. He also told guests that evening he had hoped the VVD would suffer a heavier defeat at the polls. “That was inappropriate language. I should not have said it,” he said.</p><p data-end="828" data-start="587"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1135" data-start="830">Despite the row, Wijers said he had “no doubts” he could continue his work over the next three weeks. He and the CDA’s negotiator Sybrand Buma have been tasked with drawing up a draft coalition agreement with D66 leader Rob Jetten and CDA leader Henri Bontenbal, with the option for the VVD to join later.</p><p data-end="1135" data-start="830">The VVD, which came third in last month’s general election, has been excluded from the initial talks because of Yesilgöz insistence on ruling out working with the left-wing green party GroenLinks, which came fourth.</p><p data-end="1428" data-start="1137">Wijers will not give formal advice on potential coalition partners, but he will help shape the outline of an agreement that both CDA and D66 want to command broad support.

A crash in the <a href="https://www.afm.nl/nl-nl/sector/actueel/2025/nov/sb-deepdive-ketenafhankelijkheden">value of the US dollar</a>, for example, could have profound effects.</p><p>“The current impression of apparent stability in the market is actually like a dangerously thin layer of ice – and underneath it, the waters are anything but still,” said Van Geest. “It’s ice you can stand on, but that you can also fall through.
