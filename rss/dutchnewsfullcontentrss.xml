The coalition parties want to make this ratio one to one.</p><p>The ChristenUnie and pensioners’ party 50Plus, who have four seats, have said the plan flies in the face of a binding agreement, while the FNV, one of the Netherlands’ largest trade unions, called it “unacceptable, unnecessary and unfair”.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>“Hard workers like maternity nurses and builders are seeing their hard-earned pensions moving further away,” <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2600731-vandaag-debat-over-coalitieplannen-wat-vindt-de-oppositie-ervan">said CU leader Mirjam Bikker</a>.</p><p>The CU, like GL-PvdA, is also critical of the proposed cuts to reduce incapacity benefits and cut €2 billion from elderly care, partly by introducing means testing for people living in nursing homes.</p><p>The coalition parties could seek support from parties on the right, but they are likely to run up against opposition on their environmental policies.</p><h2>Asylum laws</h2><p>JA21, which has nine seats, wants to reopen the Groningen gas fields and enable drilling in the Wadden Sea, which the coalition agreement explicitly rules out.</p><p>Party leader Joost Eerdmans has kept his cards close to his chest so far, aware that JA21’s support is potentially crucial for the coalition parties. He was due to announce his party’s broad stance on a TV talk show on Monday, but called off sick at the last minute.</p><p>The right-wing parties are also critical of the plans to build more wind farms and force farmers to downsize in order to meet European limits on nitrogen pollution.</p><p>They will also press for tougher rules against asylum seekers, such as scrapping the so-called “spreading law” which allows the government to relocate asylum seekers around the country even if it goes against the wishes of local councils.</p><p>The farmers’ party BBB, which has 12 seats in the senate, could try to force a reinstatement of the low-tax red diesel, which was one of its flagship policies when it joined the last government.</p><p>“Outstretched hand”</p><p>D66 and prospective prime minister Rob Jetten said when the coalition agreement was presented on Friday that he saw it as an “outstretched hand”, acknowledging that the three parties will have to make concessions to the opposition.</p><p>“Politics with an outstretched hand makes demands of us all: from the coalition, parliament and wider society,” <a href="https://www.nu.nl/formatie/6384390/uitgestoken-hand-bezuinigen-en-ambities-coalitie-krijgt-het-drukker-dan-ooit.html">Jetten said</a>.</p><p>Tuesday’s debate will be a first indication of how the opposition parties are likely to approach the negotiations.</p><p>BBB leader Caroline van der Plas expects the parties opposed to the pension reforms to join forces to force a rethink, while Jan Struijs of pensioners’ party 50Plus said his telephone had been ringing all weekend.</p><p>“People over 40 will have to keep working until they’re 70, and when they stop there’ll be no care for them,” Van der Plas said.</p><h2>Wilders blockade</h2><p>One party the coalition will not be able to count on is the far-right PVV, led by Geert Wilders, who has vowed to bring down the new government as quickly as possible through “uncompromising opposition”.</p><p>The PVV’s resistance has been weakened by the defection of seven MPs led by Gidi Markuszower, reducing Wilders’ faction to 19 MPs.</p><p>Markuszower said his group was prepared to co-operate with the government, but has also said the plans require “a lot of repair work”.</p><p>MPs are expected to vote in favour of the coalition agreement after Tuesday’s debate and give Rob Jetten a mandate to form a new cabinet. The real tests will come later when the three parties start to bring their draft laws to parliament.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/election-2025/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/politics/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=263112</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 10:32:33 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Gordon Darroch]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>How will the new coalition’s plans affect your finances?</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/02/how-will-the-new-coalitions-plans-affect-your-finances/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-263119 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-benefits category-healthcare category-pensions category-personal-finance"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> How will the new coalition’s plans affect your finances?</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-02-03T10:10:57+00:00"> February 3, 2026 </time> <a class="me-2" href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/author/robin/" rel="author"> Robin Pascoe </a></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-106914" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_106914"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="667" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wallet-with-euros-inflation.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wallet-with-euros-inflation.jpg 1000w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wallet-with-euros-inflation-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wallet-with-euros-inflation-560x374.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wallet-with-euros-inflation-768x512.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wallet-with-euros-inflation-300x200.jpg 300w" width="1000"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-106914"> Photo: Depositphotos.com</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><div class="relative basis-auto flex-col -mb-(--composer-overlap-px) [--composer-overlap-px:28px] grow flex"><div class="flex flex-col text-sm pb-25"><article class="text-token-text-primary w-full focus:outline-none [--shadow-height:45px] has-data-writing-block:pointer-events-none has-data-writing-block:-mt-(--shadow-height) has-data-writing-block:pt-(--shadow-height) [&amp;:has([data-writing-block])&gt;*]:pointer-events-auto scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]" data-scroll-anchor="true" data-testid="conversation-turn-20" data-turn="assistant" data-turn-id="284feab8-8c13-4235-87b2-7e20ed170917" dir="auto" tabindex="-1"><div class="text-base my-auto mx-auto pb-10 [--thread-content-margin:--spacing(4)] @w-sm/main:[--thread-content-margin:--spacing(6)] @w-lg/main:[--thread-content-margin:--spacing(16)] px-(--thread-content-margin)"><div class="[--thread-content-max-width:40rem] @w-lg/main:[--thread-content-max-width:48rem] mx-auto max-w-(--thread-content-max-width) flex-1 group/turn-messages focus-visible:outline-hidden relative flex w-full min-w-0 flex-col agent-turn" tabindex="-1"><div class="flex max-w-full flex-col grow"><div class="min-h-8 text-message relative flex w-full flex-col items-end gap-2 text-start break-words whitespace-normal [.text-message+&amp;]:mt-1" data-message-author-role="assistant" data-message-id="99b97ee1-45e4-445e-bcc5-2feefc170805" data-message-model-slug="gpt-5-2" dir="auto"><div class="flex w-full flex-col gap-1 empty:hidden first:pt-[1px]"><div class="markdown prose dark:prose-invert w-full wrap-break-word light markdown-new-styling"><p data-end="227" data-start="0">The new Dutch coalition government revealed its <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/01/the-new-governments-plans-a-round-up-of-the-main-points/">plans for the next four years</a> last Friday, and some of the ideas have already generated major opposition. Here is a round-up of the main controversies affecting people’s pockets.</p><p data-end="418" data-start="229"><strong>Social security</strong><br data-end="247" data-start="244"/>The biggest change planned for the social security system is to halve the length of time people who lose their jobs can claim unemployment benefit, from two years to one.</p><p data-end="929" data-start="420">People claiming WW would get 80% of their former salary for two months, rather than 70%, and then 70% for the rest of the period. But labour market experts told the <a href="https://fd.nl/politiek/1585403/coalitie-schiet-zichzelf-in-de-voet-met-gebroken-pensioenbelofte-en-kortere-ww">Financieele Dagblad</a> that the Dutch jobs infrastructure is not ready to cater to people who need a new job quickly and that the new government is “shooting itself in the foot”.</p><p data-end="929" data-start="420">Moreover, people who have been doing a job for five or 10 years cannot simply move to a new one, Piet Fortuin, chairman of trade union federation CNV, told the paper.</p><p data-end="1158" data-start="931">Utrecht University professor Robert Vonk told the FD that cutting WW payments will be a big issue in the next round of pay talks between unions and employers. “They will be looking for solutions for that missing year,” he said.</p><p data-end="1158" data-start="931"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1438" data-start="1160"><strong>State pension</strong><br data-end="1176" data-start="1173"/>At the moment, the state pension (AOW) rises by eight months for every 12-month increase in life expectancy and is now 67 years and three months. The new administration wants to increase the state pension age by a full year for every year life expectancy rises.</p><p data-end="1664" data-start="1440">Calculations by <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2600732-aow-leeftijd-sneller-omhoog-bekijk-hier-wat-dat-voor-jou-betekent">broadcaster NOS</a> suggest that this would push up the retirement age for someone born in 1973 by six months, to 68 years and six months, for example. And, the coalition says, it would save €2.7 billion a year.</p><p data-end="1876" data-start="1666">On average, the Dutch now stop work around the age of 66, but in 2000 that was just 61, following the abolition of early retirement schemes. The Dutch average retirement age is now the second highest in Europe.</p><p data-end="2106" data-start="1878">The unions have already criticised the proposal, describing it as unfair to people now approaching retirement age who have worked hard their entire lives. They also point to the impact on people doing physically demanding work.</p><p data-end="2354" data-start="2108">There is, however, one advantage for the Netherlands’ foreign residents. To qualify for a full state pension, you must have lived in the country for 50 years, and this will give international workers a little more time to build up pension rights.</p><p data-end="2354" data-start="2108"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="2541" data-start="2356"><strong>Healthcare</strong><br data-end="2369" data-start="2366"/>The cabinet wants to save €10 billion a year on healthcare, and this is likely to be one of the most controversial issues facing the new administration.</p><p data-end="2844" data-start="2543">Of this, €6 billion will come from increasing the own-risk element in health insurance from €385 to €460 in 2027 and then increasing it in line with inflation.

D66 senator and asylum spokesman Boris Dittrich said the party’s seven members in the upper house were still opposed to the plans. “The Senate is not bound by the coalition agreement,” <a href="https://www.trouw.nl/politiek/d66-stemt-in-de-senaat-tegen-de-twee-asielwetten-uit-het-coalitieakkoord~bf547e87/">he told Trouw</a>.</p><p>Dittrich said his objections to making illegal residence a criminal offence were unchanged. “It’s inhumane to punish people who don’t possess the right papers,” he said, adding that other laws were available to deal with illegal immigrants who cause problems for society.</p><h2>Soup clause</h2><p>The clause was one of the most controversial aspects of the proposed law, after the PVV managed to pass an amendment that would have made it an offence to assist illegal asylum seekers in any way.</p><p>D66, coalition partner CDA and the smaller Christian parties CU and SGP threatened to vote against the law on the grounds that it could criminalise acts of charity such as offering a bowl of soup to a homeless refugee.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100

“novelle”, a guidance note stating that helping asylum seekers would not be treated as an offence.</p><p>Dittrich said the D66 senators were also critical of the two-status model, under which would mean people who are directly threatened by their governments receive an “A” status and a better chance of being granted asylum, while those fleeing because of the conditions in their country would receive a “B” status.</p><p>The system was abandoned in the Netherlands in 2000 because it prompted a mass of legal challenges by asylum seekers on the “B” list.</p><p>“A lot of people with a B status challenged it in the hope of securing an A status, ” Dittrich said. “A lot of them ended up being allowed to stay.

National climate policy is thin, the paper argues, with an emphasis on subsidies, carbon capture and storage and plans for “at least four” new nuclear power stations — all VVD and CDA priorities. Measures such as a national CO₂ levy for industry and stricter targets have been dropped.</p><p data-end="1365" data-start="1013">On migration and nitrogen policy, the paper argues that D66 again moved towards its partners, accepting tougher asylum policies and weaker nitrogen targets and timelines. D66 gains, according to the Volkskrant, are limited, with the agreement containing only “relatively small amounts” for education, the rule of law, media and development cooperation.</p><p data-end="1365" data-start="1013"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="2778" data-start="2439">According to the <a href="https://fd.nl/politiek/1585262/voor-de-oppositie-moeten-de-onderhandelingen-nog-beginnen">Financieele Dagblad,</a> “the negotiations are only just beginning” for the opposition parties that will be needed to steer new legislation through parliament.

He was particularly critical of planned cuts to healthcare and social security and of the decision to speed up the rise in the state pension age, which he said undermines long-term agreements.</p><p data-end="3414" data-start="3168">The paper says the minority cabinet will have to rely heavily on deal-making in parliament and points to a central role for CDA leader Henri Bontenbal, who is staying on as parliamentary leader, where much of the political wrangling will be done.</p><h2 data-end="3414" data-start="3168">Coalition resistance</h2><p data-end="3758" data-start="3416"><a href="https://www.telegraaf.nl/politiek/oppositie-slijpt-de-messen-breed-verzet-tegen-bezuinigingen-nieuw-kabinet/128059486.html">The Telegraaf</a> focuses on mounting resistance to the coalition’s cuts, saying the opposition is “sharpening its knives” ahead of the parliamentary debate on Tuesday.
