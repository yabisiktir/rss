Only when you walk around Italian sculptor Bernini’s marble mattress do you see that this sleeping figure has both breasts and male genitals.</p><p>Sleeping Hermaphroditus is one of the star pieces in a new show at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, which collects more than 80 international masterpieces inspired by classic Greek and Roman myths.</p><p>In some 200 stories, the Roman poet Ovid described the fearful, painful and sometimes joyful interactions of gods and goddesses with the human world – a 15-book work called the Metamorphoses (derived from the Greek and Latin words for <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/metamorphosis">transformation and form</a>).</p><p>You’ll know the stories from the two centuries of artwork and literature they inspired: Medusa, with her hair of snakes and a gaze that turns men to stone. Queen Leda, “seduced” by the god Zeus in the form of a swan. Arachne, who challenged the goddess Minerva to a weaving competition, won it, and was transformed into a spider for her cheek.</p><p>With works from Titian and Caravaggio to Rubens and Rodin, the Rijksmuseum explores how artists old and new were inspired by Ovid’s stories – and reinterpreted them for their own age.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>“His work, in fact one long poem divided into 15 books, is filled with stories of classical mythology,” explains the writer Stephen Fry in the audio guide. “Tales of love, desire, jealousy, ambition, arrogance, power, despair. In all of them, transformation is the central theme… Everything is in constant flux and nothing ever truly disappears.”</p><p>Taco Dibbits, general director of the Rijksmuseum, said that the stories still speak to a modern generation, even if we no longer believe Roman gods cause our mortal woes.</p><p>“When people are touched by this enormous, godly power, a metamorphosis, a total transformation takes place,” he said at a press viewing. “But it is about universal, human feelings. Ovid’s myths describe the mystery of being touched by divine power, something that artists have tried for centuries to put into form.”</p><p>The results are anything but ethereal: the 10 rooms of the Philips wing of the museum are full of naked breasts – sometimes squirting milk – male and female genitals and stories of violence and rape. Frits Scholten, senior curator of sculpture, admitted women often got the rough end of the stick. “It’s not about mutual consent, and that’s the same for a lot of these stories,” he said. “But Ovid does not moralise, which is very interesting.”</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>The essential belief in ancient times, according to Scholten, was that even if life was nasty, brutish and short, the soul did not die. “It is about the idea that everything has a soul and that the soul is constantly moving from body to body – in nature, in things but also in people,” he said. “If you grasp that idea, then you understand better what the stories are about.”</p><p>While some of the older works were clearly “bedchamber pieces”, he said, created with an erotic intention even when they portrayed assault, the exhibition includes in every room modern artworks with a different interpretation of the myths.</p><p>Rotterdam artist Juul Kraijer’s Untitled piece inspired by Leda and the Swan shows a headless, voiceless woman, merging with the beast, for example. Femmy Otten’s wooden sculpture We Once Were One refers to classical tales of transformation with a woman emerging from a tree – the folds of her dress like enormous labia.</p><p>The exhibition includes surprising materials, representing a key idea that artists are busy transforming raw materials too. Two oysters are carved with Ovidian love stories from the sea in one room; in another is a 16<sup>th</sup> century dish attributed to Francesco “Urbini” illustrated with phalluses and the text: “every man looks at me as if I were a dick head”.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-263174" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_263174" style="width: 560px"><noscript><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-263174" decoding="async" height="420" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-03-11.24.31-560x420.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-03-11.24.31-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-03-11.24.31-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-03-11.24.31-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-03-11.24.31-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-03-11.24.31-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" width="560"/></noscript><img alt="" class="lazyload size-medium wp-image-263174" data-sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" data-src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-03-11.24.31-560x420.jpg" data-srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-03-11.24.31-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-03-11.24.31-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-03-11.24.31-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-03-11.24.31-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2026-02-03-11.24.31-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" decoding="async" height="420" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20560%20420%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="560"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-263174">Caravaggio’s Narcissus at the Rijksmuseum Photo: S Boztas</figcaption></figure><p>There are sculptures, rough plaster moulds from the French sculptor Rodin depicting bodies emerging from the stone, surrealist works and the intriguing 16<sup>th</sup> century painting by Caravaggio of Narcissus falling in love with his own reflection – before drowning and being transformed into that flower.</p><p>Dibbits said that Ovid’s stories represent the function of art itself, weaving human emotions and experiences into something durable. “Art is inspired by the stories but it’s also the metamorphosis of the material that the artist uses,” he told Dutch News. “Narcissus, who falls in love with his own image, looking in the water, in a sense stands for painting, where the portrait is as real as possible.</p><p>“The story of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pygmalion">Pygmalion</a> is stone, sculpture, and marble becoming alive.

This year she is concentrating on the shorter distance, while world champion Joy Beune missed out on a place as she could only finish fourth at the Dutch national trials.</p><p>Beune, who has won four of the five world cup rounds over her favourite distance, will be looking to make amends at the 3,000m. Marijke Groenewoud is competing in both the longer distances, but her best chance of gold is in the mass start, where she is a double world champion.</p><h2>Versatile Schulting</h2><p>Suzanne Schulting will also contest the 1,000m as she tries to become the first man or woman to win Olympic titles on the big oval and at shorttrack.</p><p>She will <a href="https://www.nu.nl/olympische-spelen/6384370/schulting-mag-olympische-shorttracktitel-op-1000-meter-niet-verdedigen-in-milaan.html">not be going for a third shorttrack gold over 1,000 metres</a>, however, after the selectors opted for the Velzenboer sisters, Xandra and Michelle, and Selma Poutsma. Schulting’s only individual outing at shorttrack will be over 1,500m, where she won bronze four years ago.</p><p>Xandra Velzenboer is a former world champion over 500m and 1,000m, while Michelle is reigning Dutch champion over all three individual disciplines.</p><h2>Nuis controversy</h2><p>In the men’s long track events, veteran Kjeld Nuis will be hoping to close out his illustrious career with a fourth Olympic title.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.rtl.nl/nieuws/binnenland/artikel/5549803/kjeld-nuis-rijdt-toch-de-1500-meter-milaan-tim-prins-gaat-niet">selection of the 36-year-old for the 1,500m was shrouded in controversy</a> after Tim Prins pipped him to third place at this year’s national championships, which act as the Olympic trials.</p><p>But the selectors picked Nuis, who won gold at the distance in Pyeongchang and Beijing and holds the world record from 2019, because Olympic rules only allow a maximum of nine men and nine women per country, and the Dutch wanted to include Marcel Bosker in the team pursuit trio.</p><p>Nuis has also qualified for the 1,000m, which he won in 2018, while Prins was left to console himself with <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2597394-na-fastfood-en-korte-nachten-staat-teleurgestelde-prins-weer-op-het-ijs-voor-ek-afstanden">a junk food blowout</a> and a long ride on his mountain bike.</p><p>Joep Wennemars <a href="https://nos.nl/liveblog/2596495-okt-eindigt-met-schaatsrelletje-tussen-wennemars-en-nuis-tweede-matrix-ingevuld">won the 1,500m at the trials</a> and is also competing in the 500m and 1,000m, while Jenning de Boo will need to rediscover his early season form if he wants to get among the medals over the shorter distances.</p><p>But both will have to overcome <a href="https://sportnieuws.nl/schaatsen/nieuws/nederlandse-topschaatsers-moeten-oppassen-tijdens-olympische-winterspelen-dit-zijn-de-gevaarlijke-concurrenten-2026013016284773836/">the American favourite Jordan Stolz</a>. The 21-year-old has been in imposing form this season, winning 15 out of 19 World Cup races across the three sprints, and could try for five gold medals in Milan.</p><p>Jorrit Bergsma will line up in the 10,000m and mass start a week after celebrating his 40<sup>th</sup> birthday and three months after he became the oldest ever Dutch national champion over the distance. The champion from 2014 will have his work cut out to get among the medals this time.</p><h2>Skeleton Bos</h2><p>On the shorttrack arena, Jens van ’t Wout, who will <a href="https://www.nu.nl/olympische-spelen/6381618/jens-van-t-wout-en-kimberley-bos-vlaggendragers-bij-openingsceremonie-spelen.html">carry the team’s flag</a> at the opening ceremony, is among the favourites in all three individual events. He will be joined by his brother Melle, Teun Boer, Itzhak de Laat and Friso Emons.</p><p>Dutch hopes are not entirely confined to the skating events. Kimberley Bos, the other team flag carrier, made history in Beijing as the first Dutch medallist away from the ice rink when she won bronze in skeleton bob.</p><p>The 32-year-old from Ede will be hoping to be on the podium again in Milan, but her best World Cup result so far this year is a fourth place in Altenberg.</p><p>The Dutch are also sending a figure skating pair to the Olympics for the first time, in the shape of Michel Tsiba and Russian-born Daria Danilova, as well as two-man and four-man men’s bobsleigh teams.</p><p>Melissa Peperkamp <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2600107-o-wacht-ik-ben-mijn-board-vergeten-een-dag-met-olympisch-snowboarder-peperkamp">is the Netherlands’ best hope for a medal in the snowboarding events</a>, where she is joined by Romy van Vreden, Michelle Dekker and Glenn de Blois.</p><p>But hopes of an unlikely Dutch medal in downhill skiing were crushed when the former giant slalom champion Marcel Hirscher, who used to compete for Austria but switched allegiance to the Netherlands two years ago, <a href="https://www.nu.nl/sport-overig/6382052/skilegende-hirscher-niet-namens-nederland-naar-spelen-ben-niet-op-topniveau.html">was unable to recover from a series of injuries</a>.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/olympics/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/skating/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/sport/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=263005</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 14:35:43 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Gordon Darroch]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Dutch transfer window dominated by big-name departures</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/02/dutch-transfer-window-dominated-by-big-name-departures/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-263178 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-eredivisie category-football category-sport"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Dutch transfer window dominated by big-name departures</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-02-04T12:21:44+00:00"> February 4, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-263182" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_263182"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="1707" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ANP-547796656-scaled.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ANP-547796656-scaled.jpg 2560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ANP-547796656-560x373.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ANP-547796656-1200x800.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ANP-547796656-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ANP-547796656-768x512.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ANP-547796656-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ANP-547796656-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" width="2560"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-263182"> AZ splashed out €4.5m on Heracles striker Jizz Hornkamp in the biggest domestic deal.

Why on earth would we make an agreement with you if you can turn round at any moment and say: forget it, those agreements didn’t really exist?”</p><h2>“Broken promises”</h2><p>Jetten stressed that the new rules, which will raise the retirement age in step with life expectancy, would not come into force until 2033 and his government would consult opposition parties and organisations such as trade unions first. “It’s up to us to find enough support,” he said.</p><p>Jan Struijs, of pensioners’ party 50Plus, also criticised the coalition parties for “breaking a hard-won pensions agreement” that was a “promise by a previous cabinet’’.</p><p>Struijs, a former police union leader, called for Jetten to make an exemption for workers in physically demanding jobs. “I know how hard it is to be on hte front line in our society for 43 years, whether it’s in the police, healthcare or the army,” he said.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>As expected, MPs voted at the end of the debate to endorse the coalition agreement and give Jetten a mandate to form a government, which is expected to be sworn in on February 23. But the debate was an early test of the willingness of opposition parties to work with the coalition to build majorities.</p><p>Rianne Letschert, who was appointed by Jetten to chair the two months of negotiations between D66, VVD and CDA, said: “The choice these parties made to form a minority cabinet is more than merely a procedural step.</p><h2>Care and asylum</h2><p>“It marks a quite unusual political reality: new, unknown and for many, I think, fairly tense. But I think the choices the party leaders have made can produce a constellation that strengthens our democracy, as long as it is crafted carefully.”</p><p>Parties on the left are likely to put pressure on the cabinet to scrap some of the measures on social security, including a €2 billion cut to elderly care and lower incapacity benefits. But on the right, they will face resistance to their plans for asylum, the environment and nitrogen reduction.</p><p>Annabel Nanninga of JA21, the largest opposition party on the right with nine seats, called for the cabinet to cut taxes and take more steps to cut the number of asylum seekers coming into the country.</p><p>The coalition has pledged to pass the previous government’s asylum laws, which would make it harder for refugees to bring their families to the Netherlands and require them to apply for a new residence permit every three years. But Nanninga said the plans did not go far enough: “We can’t cope with it now,” she said.</p><h2>Budget deficit</h2><p>The cabinet’s tighter spending plans include a budget deficit limit of 2%, lower than the European Union’s maximum of 3%, encouraging suggestions that they could be building in scope to make concessions to opposition parties.</p><p>ChristenUnie leader Mirjam Bikker called the agreement an exercise in “hard-right bookkeeping” that would hit vulnerable families on benefits or the long-term sick hardest.</p><p>But Yesilgöz warned: “The national debt is already rising. If we say we can throw money at things without causing pain, we’ll end up passing on the burden to future generations and stripping away all the buffers we have for another coronavirus or Ukraine.”</p><p>Opposition parties also focused on the proposal to raise the excess charge on health insurance from €385 to €460 a year and cut the maximum term for unemployment pay from one year to two.</p><p>Klaver said “hardworking people” would pay the price of the incoming cabinet’s plans to raised defence spending by making €16.5 billion of cuts to health and social security, as well as introducing an extra income tax payment known as the “freedom contribution”.</p><h2>Health insurance</h2><p>Chris Stoffer, leader of the orthodox Protestant SGP, said: “For people earning between €30,000 and €70,000 to €80,000 the blows keep coming”.But Dilan Yesilgöz, of the right-wing coalition party VVD, insisted that the costs were being “shared by everyone”.</p><p>Henri Bontenbal, leader of the third coalition partner CDA, said he had been reluctant to increase health insurance costs, but insisted: “It would be irresponsible for us not to do it, even if we have to explain painful choices to the voters.”</p><p>Bontenbal also reassured the Christian parties, SGP and CU, on the lack of detail on medical-ethical issues in the coalition agreement. Their leaders were concerned that D66, which was instrumental in establishing euthanasia in the Netherlands, might try to relax restrictions on surrogacy and embryo research at a later date.</p><p>“You’ll recall from previous coalitions that the parties will not surprise each other or tread on each other’s toes, and certainly not the opposition’s toes,” Bontenbal said.</p><p>Some party leaders ruled out working with the coalition’s plans point blank, notably Geert Wilders of the far-right PVV, who accused the three parties of “bleeding the Netherlands dry and giving it to Jesse Klaver”.</p><p>Socialist party leader Jimmy Dijk also urged his colleagues on the opposition benches not to do deals with D66, VVD and CDA. “Don’t do it, because they’ll stab you in the back.”</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/election-2025/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/politics/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=263155</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 10:26:26 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Gordon Darroch]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Over 250,000 people a year need emergency care due to smoking</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/02/over-250000-people-a-year-need-emergency-care-due-to-smoking/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-263160 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-health category-healthcare category-hospitals category-smoking category-vaping newsletter-include"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Over 250,000 people a year need emergency care due to smoking</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-02-04T09:13:04+00:00"> February 4, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50614" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_50614"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="316" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/outdoor-ashtray-smoking.png" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/outdoor-ashtray-smoking.png 500w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/outdoor-ashtray-smoking-300x189.png 300w" width="500"/></figure><main class="px-4"><p>Over 70 people a day need emergency care as a result of smoking and vaping, according to figures from 67 hospital emergency departments across the country.</p><p>Last year, hospitals agreed to count the number of people who came to emergency departments with smoking related problems in a <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/11/hospital-emergency-departments-count-nicotine-related-cases/">single 24-hour period</a> in November.
