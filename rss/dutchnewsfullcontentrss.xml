In the Netherlands, predominantly in North Brabant and <a href="https://www.hartvanlimburg.nl/nl/carnaval-2026">Limburg</a>, we have carnaval – without either the sparkly costumes or the religious overtones.</p><p><strong>Where does the name come from?</strong><br/> Carnaval derives from the latin, <em>carne vale</em>, meaning farewell to meat, and takes place over the weekend ahead of the six-week period of Lent. This year the celebrations start on Friday February 13, but will keep on going well into Tuesday with parades and parties – unless the beer runs out.</p><p><strong>Where to celebrate?</strong><br/> Public carnaval events are on throughout North Brabant and Limburg, but also spread as far as Gelderland, Twente and some parts of Zeeland. The biggest cities, such as Maastricht, <a href="https://www.mezz.nl/carnaval/">Breda</a> and <a href="https://www.oeteldonk.org/">Den Bosch</a>, are focal points, but most towns and villages have their own community focused parties too.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>The Dutch tradition is particularly anarchic and increasingly secular and satirical. Towns and cities change their names – Den Bosch becomes Oeteldonk; Bergen op Zoom Krabbegat and Tilburg Kruikenstad.</p><p>Normal life grinds to a halt. Shops and businesses shut or have different opening hours and roads are blocked for parades and events.</p><p>Also, don’t be surprised if you suddenly start questioning your command of the Dutch language. Many posters, adverts for events and folks attending them will switch over to dialect in the carnival season. Greet people with the ubiquitous and chirpy <em>Alaaf!,</em> with accompanying<a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaaf"> hand gesture</a> and you’ll feel at home immediately.</p><p><strong>And the music?</strong><br/> Beer and oompah music is key part of carnaval, a little like the Oktoberfest celebrations in Germany and the border regions. Every year there is a classic carnaval hit – like the classic in this <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/08/inburgering-with-dn-songs-you-have-to-be-able-to-sing-along-to/">collection of singalong songs</a>.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p><strong>Who is Prince Carnaval?<br/> </strong>Each town or village will appoint their own Prince Carnaval, and today increasingly a Princess Carnaval. On the opening day of the celebrations they are ceremoniously handed over the keys to the town by the mayor. For the next three or four days they are nominally in charge.</p><p><strong>What’s the significance of 11?<br/> </strong>The official carnaval season begins on November 11, or 11.11, a day which is now almost as busy as carnaval itself – 11 being the fool’s number in the Netherlands.</p><p>The towns and villages organising carnaval events will set up meetings of “‘court” or the organising ‘”Council of 11″ in the run-up to the festival.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-211091" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_211091" style="width: 560px"><noscript><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-211091" decoding="async" height="371" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Depositphotos_25140547_S-560x371.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Depositphotos_25140547_S-560x371.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Depositphotos_25140547_S-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Depositphotos_25140547_S-768x509.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Depositphotos_25140547_S-640x424.jpg 640w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Depositphotos_25140547_S-92x62.jpg 92w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Depositphotos_25140547_S-130x86.jpg 130w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Depositphotos_25140547_S.jpg 1000w" width="560"/></noscript><img alt="" class="lazyload size-medium wp-image-211091" data-sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" data-src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Depositphotos_25140547_S-560x371.jpg" data-srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Depositphotos_25140547_S-560x371.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Depositphotos_25140547_S-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Depositphotos_25140547_S-768x509.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Depositphotos_25140547_S-640x424.jpg 640w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Depositphotos_25140547_S-92x62.jpg 92w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Depositphotos_25140547_S-130x86.jpg 130w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Depositphotos_25140547_S.jpg 1000w" decoding="async" height="371" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20560%20371%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="560"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-211091">Photo: Depositphotos.com</figcaption></figure><p><strong>And the costumes?</strong><br/> Traditional carnaval costumes are similar to the Comedia de Arte masques of the Venice Carnival and role reversal also comes prominently into play.
