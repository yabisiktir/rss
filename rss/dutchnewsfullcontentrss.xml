against FIFA and nine European national football associations, including France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark.</p><p>Discussions have begun to settle the case, but Melcherts said the group was ready to go to court if necessary. “We have had exploratory talks, but if they don’t lead to something constructive in the first quarter of 2026, we plan to issue a summons that will set out our demands and calculations in detail,” she said.</p><p>“The European Court of Justice has determined that the rules are unfair.

A study by <a href="https://www.compasslexecon.com/">economic consultancy firm Compass Lexecon</a>, commissioned by Justice for Players in the wake of the ruling, concluded that players had lost out on around 8% of their potential earnings on average as a result of FIFA’s restrictive transfer rules.</p><p>The total bill is likely to run into billions. “It’s a huge sum, but on the other hand, the damage has been inflicted across the 27 EU member states for years,” Melcherts said.</p><p>“Footballers are employees and employees have freedom of movement. But in this case the transfer fees, the compensation [for breach of contract] and the percentages that are demanded are extremely high, which goes against the principle that if an employee wants to change jobs, they should be free to do so.”</p><p>Premier league</p><p>The case also affects the English Premier League, Europe’s richest football competition, since Britain was a member of the European Union until the end of 2020.</p><p>Diarra, who also played for Chelsea, Arsenal and Real Madrid, and won 34 caps for France, is claiming €65 million from the Belgian FA and FIFA in a separate action for loss of earnings throughout his career from 2004 to 2019, which included spells with Chelsea, Arsenal, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain.</p><p>The French international took the Belgian football association URBSFA and FIFA to court in 2015 when Charleroi withdrew their offer of a contract under pressure from Lokomotiv Moscow, who threatened to sue under FIFA’s anti-poaching rules.</p><p>Diarra never played for Charleroi as a result. Instead, FIFA ordered the player to pay the Russian club €10.5 million in damages for breach of contract and suspended him from professional football for 15 months, a decision that was upheld by the Court for Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne.</p><h2>Not just superstars</h2><p>But Melcherts stressed that it is not only the superstars who have been affected. While top players such as Kylian Mbappé and Erling Haaland command annual salaries of more than €30 million, a 2016 global study on behalf of international players’ union FIFPro found that 45% of male footballers earned less than €11,000 a year.</p><p>“We have a whole bunch of footballers in the same situation as Diarra, which is why we’ve started a mass claim on their behalf, asking FIFA to change the rules and pay compensation,” she explained.</p><p>Sports lawyers have said that the upheaval could be exploited by players and their agents during contract negotiations.</p><p>Simon Leaf, a partner at London firm Mischcon de Reya, <a href="https://www.cityam.com/fifa-embarrassed-more-player-power-forced-transfers-legal-verdicts-on-the-diarra-ruling/">told City AM</a> it was “likely to lead to more disputes between clubs and players arising, as players may be emboldened when it comes to trying to force a transfer to take place.”</p><h2>Clearer contract</h2><p>But Melcherts argued that clearer contract terms would reduce the risk of escalating disputes such as <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/uk/football/liverpool/news/mohamed-salah-leaving-liverpool-transfer-latest/3ce18ce8ba271fbdba9e354d">the row between Liverpool and their Egyptian striker Mo Salah</a>. Salah was dropped from the squad after giving an interview in which he claimed his relationship with Dutch coach Arne Slot was “broken”.</p><p>Salah agreed a new contract with Liverpool in April including an annual salary of around €30 million, but there is speculation the player’s disruptive behaviour may be an attempt to engineer a move to Saudi Arabia, where his potential earnings are several times higher.</p><p>“At the moment the amount a player has to play in compensation is highly complex and varies from player to player,” Melcherts said. “That makes It even more important to have clarity so that players know from the outset what’s going to happen and where they stand, because at the moment it’s so unpredictable.”</p><h2>Rule changes</h2><p>FIFA has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/fifa-amends-transfer-regulations-following-diarra-ruling-2024-12-23/">made some changes to its transfer rules</a> since the Diarra ruling, introducing the concept of a “just cause” setting out the grounds on which players can leave their clubs before the end of the contract if there is a dispute.</p><p>But the players’ union FIFPro has criticised the new rules as too restrictive and says they have been imposed without a proper consultative process.</p><p>“It’s a small change, but we’re not satisfied with it,” Melcherts said. “We need to come up with a system of rules that is generated by all parties working together, not imposed by one side.”</p><p>Justice for Players has set up an anonymous registration mechanism for current and former players to join the class action. So far a few hundred have signed up, but Melcherts says others may have concerns about the impact on their careers.</p><p>“Players don’t have to worry that FIFA will blacklist them somehow,” she said. “It’s totally anonymous. We need to show to the court that there is a real problem that affects footballers, and that we are representative and competent to bring the case.</p><p>“In principle it applies to all footballers: those who earn a lot and those who don’t earn as much. That’s why we’re determined to make sure the transfer rules are fair and just for everyone and they get fair and just compensation for the damage they have suffered.”</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/court-cases/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/football/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/jobs/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=261429</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 18:18:58 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Gordon Darroch]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Wolf with tracker swims over rivers, travels 30 kilometres a day</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/01/wolf-with-tracker-swims-over-rivers-travels-30-kilometres-a-day/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-261987 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-research category-society category-wolf newsletter-include"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Wolf with tracker swims over rivers, travels 30 kilometres a day</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-01-08T14:32:36+00:00"> January 8, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261988" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_261988"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="1596" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-08-at-15.20.50-scaled.png" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-08-at-15.20.50-scaled.png 2560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-08-at-15.20.50-560x349.png 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-08-at-15.20.50-1200x748.png 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-08-at-15.20.50-768x479.png 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-08-at-15.20.50-1536x958.png 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-08-at-15.20.50-2048x1277.png 2048w" width="2560"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-261988"> A wildlife camera captures wolves in motion.

At that point, they said, they had not yet received a formal letter from the court, but that the media were already reporting the ruling.</p><p data-end="842" data-start="547">The couple married on April 19 last year with a close friend acting as the registrar. They opted for a light-hearted ceremony, which they said succeeded in setting the right tone on the day.</p><p data-end="842" data-start="547"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1278" data-start="844">Under Dutch law, a marriage is only valid if both partners explicitly declare that they accept each other as spouses and will fulfill the legal duties attached to marriage.</p><p data-end="1278" data-start="844">In this case, the official asked the groom whether he wanted to stand by his partner “today, tomorrow and all the days to come”, and asked the bride whether she was “choosing him again today”. The ceremony ended without the formal legal wording required by law.</p><p data-end="1634" data-start="1280">According to the couple, someone in the audience raised concerns immediately after the ceremony and suggested repeating the vows later. However, the council official who attended the wedding decided intervention was unnecessary.</p><p data-end="1634" data-start="1280">Three months later, after the couple had returned from their honeymoon, the municipality informed them that the ceremony had not been legally valid.</p><p data-end="1634" data-start="1280"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1985" data-start="1636">The couple said one point in the court ruling was particularly painful. It stated that the officiant’s speech had been written with the help of ChatGPT.</p><p data-end="1985" data-start="1636">“That is not true,” they said. Their friend had only asked an AI tool to check whether his text met the legal requirements, they said, stressing they wanted to defend him against public criticism.</p><p data-end="2502" data-start="2209">The error came to light later when a civil registry official reviewed an audio recording of the ceremony and found the mandatory legal text was missing. The council was then required to inform the public prosecution service, which asked the court to strike the marriage from the register.</p><h2 data-end="2502" data-start="2209">Wedding date</h2><p data-end="2750" data-start="2504">The couple asked whether they could keep their original wedding date, which marked 10 years of their relationship, but the court rejected the request, saying it could not deviate from the law despite understanding the date’s personal importance.</p><p data-end="3071" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="" data-start="2752">They have since married again in a short ceremony at the town hall in July. That date is now their official wedding anniversary, though not the one they say they will remember. “It’s unfortunate it turned out this way,” they told RTL. “We’ve been dealing with it for almost a year. Hopefully, one day we’ll laugh about it.”</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/ai/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/court-cases/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/society/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=261972</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 13:31:59 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Noor and Noah top most popular names for babies in 2025</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/01/noor-and-noah-top-most-popular-names-for-babies-in-2025/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-261953 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-children category-society newsletter-include"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Noor and Noah top most popular names for babies in 2025</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-01-08T10:11:29+00:00"> January 8, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-208813" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_208813"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="750" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Depositphotos_71149505_S.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Depositphotos_71149505_S.jpg 1000w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Depositphotos_71149505_S-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Depositphotos_71149505_S-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Depositphotos_71149505_S-640x480.jpg 640w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Depositphotos_71149505_S-83x62.jpg 83w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Depositphotos_71149505_S-130x98.jpg 130w" width="1000"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-208813"> Blue for a boy.
