That isn’t the case.”</p><p data-end="2712" data-start="2482">Immunologist Ger Rijkers said it is inevitable the British virus will reach the Netherlands. “Viruses don’t respect borders,” he said.

In 2020, starters accounted for just 27% of home purchases.</p><p data-end="502" data-start="292">The increase is largely due to government measures aimed at improving access to the housing market, including the exemption from transfer tax and the introduction of buy-to-let restrictions, the Kadaster said.</p><p data-end="790" data-start="504">Another key factor is a sell-off wave by private landlords, who are disposing of their properties because tighter regulation has made renting less profitable.
