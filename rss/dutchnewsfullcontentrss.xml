Leader Jimmy Dijk called it a “neoliberal vision that will cause more inequality and polarisation”.</p><p> </p><p> </p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light

The PVV is one of two parties, along with Forum voor Democratie, that D66 and CDA have ruled out including in a coalition.</p><p>Buma said the two leaders had made “tough choices”, but the real difficult choices will have to be made when other parties join them at the negotiating table.</p><p>The parties deliberately chose to leave out any details of how their plans would be funded, since money tends to be the main sticking point in forming coalitions. That allowed CDA and D66 to present a wish list that appeals to nearly all parties, but also forces all prospective partners to make concessions.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>The programme includes ideas for the next cabinet term, but also long-term ambitions for “tomorrow and the day after”, emphasising the parties’ determination not to get bogged down in short-term thinking.</p><p>They aim to achieve the target of building 100,000 homes a year, which the last two cabinets set but failed to realise, with 21 large newbuild projects and extending existing suburbs, but D66’s flagship policy of building 10 new cities is conspicuous by its absence.</p><p>Dilan Yesilgöz, leader of the right-wing liberal VVD, said she was willing to work on “concrete solutions for the problems of our time”. “We will examine this document to see if there are enough points on which we can hold further discussions,” she said.</p><p>CDA and D66 included a commitment to phase out mortgage interest tax relief, which the VVD said it would protect during the election campaign, but the two parties did not specify any timetable.</p><p>They also want to retain the so-called “spreading law” for asylum seekers, giving the government the power to force local councils to accommodate asylum seekers, which divided the VVD.</p><p>Yesilgöz and the parliamentary party broadly opposed it, even though it was originally drafted by the former VVD asylum minister Eric van der Burg and supported by the party’s Senate faction.</p><h2>Four parties</h2><p>Yesilgöz is also continuing to rule out joining a cabinet that includes the left-wing alliance of GroenLinks-PvdA, which is the only combination of four parties that would have a clear majority in parliament.</p><p>GL-PvdA leader Jesse Klaver also said he was willing to negotiate on D66 and CDA’s plans, even though they were “not green enough”. The two parties agreed to maintain the current target of bringing nitrogen compound emissions below legal limits by 2035, even though D66 and GL-PvdA want to move this deadline to 2030.</p><p>Jetten and Bontenbal have hinted they are willing to consider a minority cabinet, which would allow them to form a three-party coalition with the VVD or include another right-wing party such as JA21.</p><p>Both leaders criticised the previous cabinet, a four-way right-wing combination in which none of the party leaders held ministerial posts, as a failed experiment. But Buma also said there was an “urgent” need for new leadership, since Dick Schoof’s caretaker cabinet of VVD and BBB only has 26 seats.</p><p>“We’re used to majority cabinets in the Netherlands that are more stable in terms of seats, but nobody wants to see an endless formation process,” Jetten said.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/election-2025/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/politics/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=260665</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 09:50:09 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Gordon Darroch]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Researchers alarmed as study suggests many teens vape at night</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/12/researchers-alarmed-as-study-suggests-many-teens-vape-at-night/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-260671 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-health category-research category-smoking category-teenagers category-tobacco"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Researchers alarmed as study suggests many teens vape at night</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2025-12-03T09:32:52+00:00"> December 3, 2025 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-251747" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_251747"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="685" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Depositphotos_336611032_S.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Depositphotos_336611032_S.jpg 1000w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Depositphotos_336611032_S-560x384.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Depositphotos_336611032_S-768x526.jpg 768w" width="1000"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-251747"> A quarter of Dutch teens have tried vaping.

Almost half of them — 396 teenagers — said they had smoked or vaped in the past year, and 183 reported doing so daily.</p><p data-end="650" data-start="456">Most started using nicotine around the age of 13, often progressing to cigarettes and “underscoring policymakers’ responsibility to limit the tobacco industry’s influence and reduce youth access to nicotine products,” the researchers said.</p><p data-end="650" data-start="456"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1257" data-start="992">Doctors involved in the study said the night-time use of e-cigarettes is a clear indicator of dependence. They also warned that many parents remain unaware their children smoke. When parents do know, they said, it is often easier for teenagers to seek help to stop.</p><p data-end="1296" data-start="1039">Addiction expert Reinout Wiers, a professor of developmental psychopathology at the University of Amsterdam told the <a href="https://www.volkskrant.nl/wetenschap/jongeren-vapen-s-nachts-door-in-bed-ze-hunkeren-naar-nicotine~bad3da8c/">Volkskrant</a>  he was surprised by how many teenagers vape at night. “I find it alarming,” he said.</p><p data-end="1877" data-start="1298">E-cigarette vapour contains substances that can irritate or damage the respiratory system, and users face an increased cancer risk. Most vapes contain nicotine, which is highly addictive and especially risky for teenagers because their brains are still developing. Vapes cannot be sold legally to the under-18s.</p><p data-end="1877" data-start="1298"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1877" data-start="1298">Nicotine also acts as a stimulant. “Your heart rate goes up. If you take it at night, you’re less likely to fall back asleep,” Wiers said. “Poor sleep is a direct route to mental health problems and poor performance at school.”</p><p data-end="2261" data-start="1879">The findings come as the government launches a new anti-vaping campaign. Lung specialists and addiction doctors have repeatedly warned about the growing popularity of vapes.</p><p data-end="2261" data-start="1879">At least five teenagers and young adults in the Netherlands have almost died after excessive vaping and four were kept in an artificial coma for a longer period, <a href="https://www.rtl.nl/nieuws/binnenland/artikel/5507805/nederlanders-bijna-dood-vapen-robin-dagenlang-coma-intensive-care">RTL Nieuws</a> said earlier this year.</p><p><main class="px-4">Research has also shown that some vapes popular with teenagers are packed with <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2024/05/some-vapes-chock-a-block-with-harmful-chemicals-rtl-nieuws/">toxic metals, cancer-causing chemicals</a>, and a much higher level of nicotine than legally allowed.</main></p><p></p></main></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=260671</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 09:32:52 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Economy minister cancels China mission amid Nexperia tensions</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/12/economy-minister-cancels-china-mission-amid-nexperia-tensions/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-260668 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-business category-china category-chips category-economy category-tech newsletter-include"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Economy minister cancels China mission amid Nexperia tensions</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2025-12-03T09:12:35+00:00"> December 3, 2025 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-259956" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_259956"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="667" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/vincent-karremans-5.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/vincent-karremans-5.jpg 1000w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/vincent-karremans-5-560x374.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/vincent-karremans-5-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/vincent-karremans-5-768x512.jpg 768w" width="1000"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-259956"> Economic affairs minister

In today’s meaty Dutch market offering less than the asking price in property hot spots (propspots ) like Utrecht, Amsterdam, Rotterdam or The Hague, will have disbelieving sellers and their agents slapping their thighs in mirth whilst showing you the door.</p><p>“It’s a horrible system, this secret bidding thing. Why not just have an open, online auction? You bid up to your budget, and if it goes higher, that’s tough,” we ask. “This is the way we do it here,” we are told.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>We bid on one apartment and later found out that our offer was third highest. The second highest bid was €1,000 more than ours. The ‘winning’ bid was €26,000 more. In theory, in an open auction, that buyer could have bid €1 more than the next highest bid and they would have had €25,999 in the bank for a new kitchen, which the place sorely needed.</p><p>When we started looking for apartments we were advised that we could never hope to buy a place in a propspot without hiring an <em>aankoopmakelaar</em>.  They are hotshot agents of the property world. They will do all the donkey work regarding your move – check locations, accompany you on inspection tours, liaise with selling agents, check contracts, advise on the financials etc etc.</p><p>An <em>aankoopmakelaar</em> may suggest that you don’t bid an exact amount, on a property, say €500,000, but, €500,579. This random amount would just top a typical round figure bid. Why would a seller eschew an extra €579? That’s half a decent tumble dryer for their new place.</p><p>We saw this phenomenon many times and employed it ourselves with spectacular results. On the apartment we eventually purchased our extraneous amount of a few hundred euros actually related to the months of our daughters’ birthdays. The next highest bid, also with an obscure figure tagged on, was just €134 lower. I fear their kids were born in the wrong months.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>As with any group of like minded professionals a quasi masonic <em>aankoopmakelaar</em> sub-culture exists in which the industry specialists trade rumours, gossip, chitchat, nudges, winks and inside information – all potentially indispensable knowledge that mere buyers could never be privvy to.</p><p>The bidding process itself is opaque, deadlines are there to be broken, nothing in the process is written in stone, let alone bricks, or indeed mortar. Money talks louder than deadlines. So, how much to overbid exactly?</p><p>At the time of writing, in three of the propspots, I would  say this: Utrecht, 15-20%; The Hague, 10-15%; Almere, 7-10%. But the market changes quickly. I am not an <em>aankoopmakelaar</em>. You have not paid me three grand upfront (€3000). Please don’t quote me on this.</p><h2>Celebrating</h2><p>While we were smugly celebrating our unaided success we alas failed to hear an overexcited cash register clanging away in the background, a sound which accompanies every house sale – financial advisor (€3000); notaries (€2000); transfer tax (2% of the selling price; 0% on newbuilds); Taxatie report (€150-€775); and, for the linguistically challenged, translators (€250).</p><p>The euphoria of having eventually secured a place quickly dissipated when we realised we had to sell our own house, something that had, up to this point, apparently not crossed our minds.</p><p>And when you are selling a house in the Netherlands you suddenly start living in two parallel worlds: the world of your normal, messy life, juxtaposed alongside the wonderful white and empty world of Makelaarlaland.</p><p>Dutch <em>makelaars</em> (fee: 1-1.5% of the sale price) will suggest your chances of a sale improve if your house is white and empty. Unless you happen to live in a disused salt mine you are thus required to paint all the walls white and despatch all your personal belongings to the local dump.</p><h2>Quick paint job</h2><p>So we had to shape up. Apart from doing a rapid paint job and securing the mandatory energy rating (€280), we quickly learned that in Makelaarlaland these things are unwelcome: all personal items (especially family photos); unsightly kitchen equipment; old style pedestal toilets; untidy books; too much furniture;  loose wires; cats; dead plants; colour; junk; mess.</p><p>When the makelaar came to inspect our house before the first viewings it echoed like a coroner’s corridor. We had thrown out enough noise-swallowing fabrics and furnishings to kit out a childs’ soft play area. Our house was no longer a house, but a commodity to sell.</p><p>We achieved our Makelaarlaland state of nirvana by ruthlessly editing our junk. We spent so much time at the local recycling centre we were given a loyalty card. And once we had de-cluttered, and tidied the place up it was time for our makelaar’s photographer (€650-€750) to take photographs using his Naomi-Campbell-Tardis Lens, a unique optical attachment which makes all houses look way more beautiful, and far bigger on the inside, than they actually are.</p><h2>Viewing days</h2><p>These photographs ended up on funda.nl, the pre-eminent Dutch website in the Netherlands for buying/selling/renting houses/apartments. And, of course, everything must remain tidy for at least  3-4 viewing days. In Makelaarlaland this means you are forever frantically secreting unsightly household objects, usually in places they don’t belong.</p><p>“Where are the toothbrush chargers?” I asked my wife. “Try the cupboard under the stairs,” she replied.</p><p>The problem with giving your house the mother of all spring cleans is that it suddenly becomes a decent place to live. I quite liked our house now. Do I really want to move?</p><h2>More costs</h2><p>But we had to. After all, we had a buyer and had booked  a removal company (€1500-€3500, depending on distance, location, how much packing you want to do yourself etc).</p><p>So did my stress levels soar during this whole process? Absolutely. Especially during the bidding process for the houses we bought and sold. And I almost suffered a nervous breakdown when I quietly pondered that we were spending quite a few hundred thousand euros on a property that we had only seen twice, for 20 minutes each time.</p><p>To save you all locating the calculator app on your phone, and using an extremely broad emulsion brush, when you buy and sell a house in the region of €500,000 expect to pay anything between €25,000-€30,000 on all the extraneous expenses. Plus €579, of course.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" href="/life-in-the-netherlands/column/"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/housing/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=259946</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 08:13:23 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>D66 and CDA aim to woo coalition partners with “open invitation”</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/12/d66-and-cda-aim-to-woo-coalition-partners-with-open-invitation/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-260656 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-election-2025 category-politics"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> D66 and CDA aim to woo coalition partners with “open invitation”</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2025-12-02T17:04:18+00:00"> December 2, 2025 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-260657" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_260657"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="1987" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-543681437-scaled.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-543681437-scaled.jpg 2560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-543681437-560x435.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-543681437-1200x932.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-543681437-768x596.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-543681437-1536x1192.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-543681437-2048x1590.jpg 2048w" width="2560"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-260657"> Henri Bontenbal (l) of the CDA and D66 leader Rob Jetten at the presentation of the policy document.
