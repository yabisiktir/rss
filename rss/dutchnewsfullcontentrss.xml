breaches in the Netherlands has been increasing. “The Netherlands is an innovative, prosperous country and has a strategically important position within the EU and Nato with a concentration of secret information in the departments,” he said.</p><p>At an earlier preliminary hearing, El M said he “had in no way handed over state secrets to anyone”.</p><h2>Email traffic</h2><p>However, the public

though the new coalition of D66, VVD and CDA included them in its programme for government.</p><p>The plans include limiting residency permits to three years, creating a two-tier system for refugees, and making it a crime to live in the Netherlands without legal status.</p><p>While in opposition D66 was one of the fiercest critics of the plans, introduced by former asylum minister Marjolein Faber of the far-right PVV party.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center

but sometimes you have to go the extra mile,” D66 leader and prospective prime minister Rob Jetten told Nieuwsuur last week. “The Netherlands needs clarity when it comes to asylum policy.”</p><p>But D66 senator and asylum spokesman Boris Dittrich said the party’s seven members in the upper house were still opposed to the plans. “The Senate is not bound by the coalition agreement,” <a href="https://www.trouw.nl/politiek/d66-stemt-in-de-senaat-tegen-de-twee-asielwetten-uit-het-coalitieakkoord~bf547e87/">he told Trouw</a>.</p><p>Dittrich said his objections to making illegal residence a criminal offence were unchanged. “It’s inhumane to punish people who don’t possess the right papers,” he said, adding that other laws were available to deal with illegal immigrants who cause problems for society.</p><h2>Soup clause</h2><p>The clause was one of the most controversial aspects of the proposed law, after the PVV managed to pass an amendment that would have made it an offence to assist illegal asylum seekers in any way.</p><p>D66, coalition partner CDA and the smaller Christian parties CU and SGP threatened to vote against the law on the grounds that it could criminalise acts of charity such as offering a bowl of soup to a homeless refugee.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100

“novelle”, a guidance note stating that helping asylum seekers would not be treated as an offence.</p><p>Dittrich said the D66 senators were also critical of the two-status model, under which would mean people who are directly threatened by their governments receive an “A” status and a better chance of being granted asylum, while those fleeing because of the conditions in their country would receive a “B” status.</p><p>The system was abandoned in the Netherlands in 2000 because it prompted a mass of legal challenges by asylum seekers on the “B” list.</p><p>“A lot of people with a B status challenged it in the hope of securing an A status, ” Dittrich said. “A lot of them ended up being allowed to stay. We don’t want to make that distinction.”</p><p>If D66 votes against the laws in the upper house, the other two coalition partners VVD and CDA could still count on the support of the farmers’ party BBB and the right-wing JA21. But they will still need to find another nine votes, which could potentially be provided by the PVV, the far-right FVD and the CU.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/asylum/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/d66/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/election-2025/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/politics/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=263101</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 08:51:46 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Gordon Darroch]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Dutch housing shortage grows as investors turn their backs</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/02/dutch-housing-shortage-grows-as-investors-turn-their-backs/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-263104 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-construction category-house-prices category-housing category-real-estate category-rental-housing"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Dutch housing shortage grows as investors turn their backs</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-02-03T08:44:20+00:00"> February 3, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-251315" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_251315"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="1512" sizes="(max-width: 2016px) 100vw, 2016px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9226.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9226.jpg 2016w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9226-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9226-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9226-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9226-1536x1152.jpg 1536w" width="2016"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-251315"> Photo: Dutch News</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><p data-end="359" data-start="142">The shortage of housing in the Netherlands has now <a href="https://www.capitalvalue.nl/insights/voorraad-huurwoningen-krimpt/">stretched to 410,000</a>, and more investment in rental properties is becoming increasingly urgent, according to a new report by real estate advisory group Capital Value.</p><p data-end="510" data-start="361">The number of households in the Netherlands has expanded by 80,000, but the size of the housing stock has only gone up by 70,000, Capital Value said.</p><p data-end="759" data-start="512">The outgoing cabinet had a target of 100,000 new homes a year, and that has been adopted by the incoming administration.

Measures such as a national CO₂ levy for industry and stricter targets have been dropped.</p><p data-end="1365" data-start="1013">On migration and nitrogen policy, the paper argues that D66 again moved towards its partners, accepting tougher asylum policies and weaker nitrogen targets and timelines.

During that debate, parties will try to establish whether there is any appetite to back measures such as a faster rise in the state pension age or cuts to unemployment benefits.</p><p data-end="4132" data-start="3760">Klaver has already said he wants to see a “fundamental change of course”, and other parties have also flagged their own red lines, the paper says. The BBB, for example, opposes cuts to healthcare and parts of the climate and nitrogen strategy, while several parties, including the ChristenUnie, see the pension age increase as a major problem.</p><p data-end="4428" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="" data-start="4134">The Telegraaf also reports that opposition parties are trying to avoid being played off against each other. Jan Struijs, leader of the one-man party 50Plus, says that “finding friends and forming coalitions will be our core business”, and the paper concludes that the real test will come later when the coalition’s first budget is published in September.</p><p data-end="4428" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="" data-start="4134">MPs will debate the coalition agreement on Tuesday, with Klaver, as leader of the biggest opposition party, kicking off the proceedings.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/politics/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=263096</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:45:33 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>January snow caused record number of train delays in Netherlands</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/02/january-snow-caused-record-number-of-train-delays-in-netherlands/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-263093 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-society category-trains category-transport"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> January snow caused record number of train delays in Netherlands</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-02-02T16:00:26+00:00"> February 2, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-227812" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_227812"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="666" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Depositphotos_17196987_S.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Depositphotos_17196987_S.jpg 1000w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Depositphotos_17196987_S-560x373.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Depositphotos_17196987_S-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Depositphotos_17196987_S-768x511.jpg 768w" width="1000"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-227812"> Photo: Depositphotos.com</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><p>January’s cold snap led to a record number of problems on the Dutch railway network, with more than 700 faults reported over the course of the month.</p><p>The number of weather-related faults was 68, nearly three times as many as the previous record of 25 in November 2013, according to figures compiled by website <a href="https://www.rijdendetreinen.nl/">rijdendetreinen.nl.</a></p><p>Most of the problems were in the first week of January, when heavy snow and ice caused huge delays on the roads and railways, particularly in the north and east of the country.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>The biggest impact on the railway network was in the west, with Rotterdam Centraal, Leiden Centraal and Schiphol Airport worst hit.
