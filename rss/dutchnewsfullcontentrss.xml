Here are some things to think about when deciding what sort of mortgage to take out.</strong></p><p>Once you’ve had a chat with a mortgage adviser and determined your budget, you should also start thinking about which <a href="https://www.abnamro.nl/en/personal/mortgages/applying-for-mortgage/mortgage-types/index.html?utm_id=cp8723097034&amp;utm_campaign=0131-36-25-aab-bmc-expats-xs-hoe-expats-sep25&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_source=direct-deal&amp;utm_content=dutchnews-ApplyinyForMortage&amp;utm_term=0&amp;url_id=tid7741549308&amp;business_line=bmc&amp;utm_marketing_tactic=think&amp;cc_product=no-cc&amp;media_type=display-native&amp;po_number=5700081876&amp;publisher_channel=direct-deal&amp;campaign_type=start/stop">type of mortgage would suit you best</a>.</p><p>There are lots of different sorts of mortgage in the Netherlands, but only annuity and linear mortgages are eligible for tax relief – a benefit for homeowners which allows you to deduct the interest payments you make on the loan from your income tax bill.</p><p>Both an annuity and a linear mortgage can run for up to 30 years. Every annuity and linear mortgage payment includes two parts: repayment of the loan and interest. The difference between the two lies in how you repay your mortgage each month.</p><p><strong>Paying off the loan<br/> </strong><br/> “Take a mortgage of €500,000, an interest rate of 4% and a duration of 30 years,” says ABN AMRO mortgage advisor Steven Goedeman in the video below. “With an annuity mortgage, you pay the same amount every month — in this case €2,387. In the beginning, a large part of this payment is interest, and a smaller part goes towards paying off the principal loan.</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qBo8yEufxbI?si=uyLnuuHY9jJ-wdeY" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p><p>“Over time, the interest part decreases and the repayment portion increases. And as long as the interest rate is fixed, the total monthly amount stays the same. That makes an annuity mortgage predictable, so you always know how much you have to pay.”</p><p>With a linear mortgage, however, you repay the same amount of the loan each month (€1,394), plus interest on the remaining loan. Because the loan gets smaller with each repayment, you pay less interest over time — meaning your total monthly payment decreases. In this case, you would start by paying €3,056 a month and end on €1,394. You repay more upfront, so you pay less interest overall.</p><p>“In short: an annuity mortgage gives peace of mind with fixed costs, while a linear mortgage saves money in the long run,” says Steven.<br/> Which is best for you depends on your situation, so this is something to talk to a mortgage advisor about. At the same time, you can discuss how long you want to fix the interest rate for and all the other options open to you.</p><p>If you are considering buying a home, feel free to reach out to Steven or one of his ABN AMRO colleagues for a free consultation.  <a href="https://www.abnamro.nl/en/personal/mortgages/buying-a-house/index.html?utm_id=cp8723097034&amp;utm_campaign=0131-36-25-aab-bmc-expats-xs-hoe-expats-sep25&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_source=direct-deal&amp;utm_content=dutchnews-BuyingAHouse&amp;utm_term=0&amp;url_id=tid7741549308&amp;business_line=bmc&amp;utm_marketing_tactic=think&amp;cc_product=no-cc&amp;media_type=display-native&amp;po_number=5700081876&amp;publisher_channel=direct-deal&amp;campaign_type=start/stop"><em>Find out more</em></a></p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/housing/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/mortgages/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=259735</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 09:37:32 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Falling popularity hits VVD finances; MPs may face funding call</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/11/falling-popularity-hits-vvd-finances-mps-may-face-funding-call/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-259730 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-election-2025 category-politics category-provincial-government category-vvd"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Falling popularity hits VVD finances; MPs may face funding call</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2025-11-10T09:21:21+00:00"> November 10, 2025 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224194" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_224194"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="1914" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG-9038-scaled.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG-9038-scaled.jpg 2560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG-9038-560x419.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG-9038-1200x897.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG-9038-768x574.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG-9038-1536x1148.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG-9038-2048x1531.jpg 2048w" width="2560"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-224194"> Photo: Senay Boztas</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><p data-end="312" data-start="104">The right-wing VVD’s financial situation has become so serious that the party leadership is considering requiring its elected officials to donate part of their salary to the party, the <a href="https://www.volkskrant.nl/politiek/financiele-situatie-vvd-nijpend-bestuur-overweegt-eigen-politici-te-verplichten-deel-salaris-af-te-staan~b8121b4f/">Volkskrant </a>reported at the weekend.</p><p data-end="635" data-start="314">In a letter and financial report sent to members, the party board warned that “the continuity of our party is under pressure.”</p><p data-end="635" data-start="314">The VVD’s income has dropped sharply as the number of parliamentary seats has fallen from 41 in 2012 to just 22 now.

In response, then infrastructure minister Barry Madlener said supervision would be stepped up by the transport ministry’s inspection agency (ILT), the product safety authority NVWA, and customs officers.</p><p data-end="1024" data-start="695">Nine months later, little has changed. The ILT told the Parool that only one inspection project is currently planned, while the NVWA said it has had “no reason” to seize unsafe electric bicycles this year. The ILT’s last press release on fatbikes dates from September 2024, when <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2024/09/inspectors-intercept-over-16000-illegal-fatbikes-from-china/">16,500 illegal Chinese bikes</a> were intercepted.</p><p data-end="1024" data-start="695"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1271" data-start="1026">Both watchdogs say they have been in talks with online platforms, and that fewer illegal models are now being offered for sale. Bol.com said it had removed 121 listings this year, while Marktplaats declined to give figures but said it is taking action.</p><p data-end="1581" data-start="1273">Nevertheless, industry groups say those efforts fall far short of what is needed. “The legal market is under control, but illegal fatbikes remain easy to find online,” a spokesman for the RAI Vereniging, which represents the bicycle industry, told the paper. “The promised increase in enforcement has not yet produced results.”</p><p data-end="1789" data-start="1583">Police also report no visible improvement, and responsibility for enforcement remains divided between the different agencies. The ILT monitors mopeds, the NVWA checks electric bicycles, and fatbikes often fall between the two categories.</p><p data-end="1789" data-start="1583"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1982" data-start="1791">The ILT and NVWA now say they will begin joint inspections by the end of 2025. “We have invested this year in cooperation with customs and the police to achieve more results,” the ILT said.</p><p data-end="2233" data-start="1984">Manufacturers say stronger action is overdue. “The ILT and NVWA have been asleep for too long,” said Mels van Hoolwerff of Dutch fatbike brand Phatfour. “If you add up the cost of parts, labour and transport, it’s impossible to make a fatbike that cheap.”</p><p data-end="2421" data-start="2235">Estimates of how many fatbikes are now in circulation vary widely.

following a complaint by consumer organisations.</p><p>In June 2023, European consumer group BEUC and 23 of its member organisations, including Dutch consumer authority Consumentenbond, denounced claims by 17 airlines suggesting that air travel could be “sustainable” or “green”.</p><p>After a 1.5-year investigation, the European Commission said on Friday that 21 airlines had agreed to change their practices.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center

contributions to climate projects elsewhere in the world, or that the use of alternative aviation fuels – not yet ready for the market – can significantly reduce the climate impact of flying.</p><p>The companies will also refrain from using vague terms about achieving climate goals in the future and provide instead clear timelines or evidence to support their claims.</p><p>The announcement followed dialogue with the EU executive led by the Dutch consumers authority ACM, together with the consumers authorities of Belgium, Norway and Spain.</p><div class="ad-container

sustainable flying is possible.”</p><p><a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2024/03/klm-misled-consumers-with-green-claims-court-rules/">In March 2024</a>, a court in Amsterdam ruled that KLM had misled

Photo: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><p>Some people come to the Netherlands for a job, while some of their partners carry on working remotely for theirs, which is based in another country.</p><p>But when that happens, the foreign employer has new obligations around administration and withholding tax – and this is the moment when it can be good to involve an expert.</p><p>“International companies that are not based in the Netherlands could have employees working in the Netherlands for a number of reasons” says Sandro, a payroll expert at tax advice firm Blue Umbrella.</p><p>“For example, people move here with a 30% ruling [tax break for scarce talent] and their partner keeps on working for a US company. The company says: you are working from home, but ‘from home’ suddenly means working from home in the Netherlands.”</p><h2>Staying longer</h2><p>Research by the Dutch statistics office CBS earlier this year found that employees coming to the Netherlands are more likely to stay longer if they have children and if their partner has a paid job. A report from the Advisory Council on Migration in the summer suggested that the partners of knowledge migrants could help fill job vacancies in the Netherlands.</p><p>But since learning Dutch is not an instant process, and Dutch recruitment can be challenging, Blue Umbrella sees may people continue to work for their old international employers.</p><p>That means payroll administration needs to be set up, Dutch taxes need to be paid monthly to the <em>Belastingdienst</em>, and foreign companies also need to deal with the fact that exchange rates can vary. Setting up a Dutch bank account is tricky for non-resident entities and there are bank fees involved with transferring money.</p><h2>A solution</h2><p>Blue Umbrella has one solution – the<a href="https://www.blueumbrella.nl/payroll-services"> PoBo</a> (“payment on behalf of”) package. Like a deposit account, this holds several months of salary and fees, and then Blue Umbrella ensures the worker is paid the correct amount on time, payroll administration is up to date and the tax bill is settled.</p><p>“Besides the fact that you as an employer have lower transfer fees, it’s also just easier to transfer one large amount and then we do the specifications,” says Sandro. “We specify the payment reference, we use the right bank account number to the Dutch tax office. It makes it easier.”</p><p>The PoBo service also prevents annoying mix-ups such as companies that do not realise every payment to the tax office needs a new reference number.</p><h2>Reference numbers</h2><p>“What goes wrong when they pay themselves is sometimes forgetting a payment reference, which sounds silly, but every month the payment reference is different,” Sandro says. “They cannot just pay the tax office: they really have to mention their payment. And not paying on time is another thing. We do see that people receive fines for paying too late.”</p><p>Blue Umbrella’s PoBo service costs an additional €25 a month on top of the €89 a month standard payroll service – and is being used by clients from America, Germany, Denmark and other European countries.</p><p>“Employees like to get paid their salary on time – although you hear from them quicker if it doesn’t happen!” says Sandro. “And their employers like the simplicity.”</p><p><a href="https://www.blueumbrella.nl/contact"><em>Contact Blue Umbrella</em></a><em> for advice on all of your tax and business affairs in the Netherlands</em></p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/tax/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=259620</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 11:21:08 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Foster parents face 11 years in jail for abusing four children</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/11/foster-parents-face-11-years-in-jail-for-abusing-four-children/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-259708 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-abuse category-children category-court-cases category-society"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Foster parents face 11 years in jail for abusing four children</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2025-11-08T11:19:11+00:00"> November 8, 2025 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156363" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_156363"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="398" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/court-room.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/court-room.jpg 600w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/court-room-560x371.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/court-room-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/court-room-92x62.jpg 92w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/court-room-130x86.jpg 130w" width="600"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-156363"> A Dutch courtroom.
