The job of local councillor is a part time position.</p><p data-end="1154" data-start="924">Of the nearly 8,500 councillors elected in 2022, more than 1,250 have already quit local politics, while about 1,000 others have become aldermen or mayors. Most departures occurred around the halfway point of the four-year term.</p><p data-end="1539" data-start="1156">Almost half of those who left cited personal reasons, often linked to the difficulty of combining council work with a job or family life.

The fact that so many councillors cannot balance their duties with other commitments “goes against the essence of the role,” he said.</p><p data-end="1930" data-start="1541">“It is meant to be a secondary position, keeping councillors closely connected to society,” he said. “If that no longer works, it damages local democracy.”</p><p data-end="1930" data-start="1541"><a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/11/terneuzen-mayor-resigns-claiming-intimidation-over-refugee-vote/">Intimidation also plays a role</a> in some resignations, even though councillors did not mention it explicitly in the research, he said. “Aggression has increased over the past two years, especially in debates about asylum centres,” he said.</p><p data-end="2954" data-start="2675">Because this is the first time the figures have been examined in detail, there is no clear comparison with previous terms.
