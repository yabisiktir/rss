What matters at a time of high house prices is how much you can borrow.”</p><p><strong>What is changing in 2026?</strong><br/> While we wait and see what the new government is planning, some changes for 2026 that affect home buyers have already been agreed.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261345" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_261345" style="width: 560px"><noscript><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-261345" decoding="async" height="420" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0821-560x420.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0821-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0821-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0821-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0821-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0821.jpg 2016w" width="560"/></noscript><img alt="" class="lazyload size-medium wp-image-261345" data-sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" data-src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0821-560x420.jpg" data-srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0821-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0821-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0821-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0821-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0821.jpg 2016w" decoding="async" height="420" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20560%20420%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="560"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-261345">Sold and starting renovations immediately.

From 2027, homeowners will no longer be able to deduct the energy they feed back into the grid and will have to pay a fee, reducing the financial benefit of solar panels.</p><p>As a result, the extra borrowing available for A+++ homes will drop by €5,000 to €25,000, and for A++++ homes by €10,000 to €30,000, although the allowance for buyers of E, F and G-label homes to borrow an additional €20,000 for improvements remains unchanged.</p><p>Several tax and guarantee rules will also shift next year. The property transfer tax exemption for first-time buyers aged up to 34 will apply to homes costing up to €550,000 in 2026, while the rate for second home purchases will fall from 10.4% to 8%.</p><p>In addition, the national mortgage guarantee scheme will cover homes valued at up to €470,000, or €498,200 when combined with energy-saving measures.</p><p>Check out how much you can borrow with an <a href="https://expatmortgages.nl/mortgagecalculator">online mortgage calculator.</a></p><p><strong>Reassess your situation</strong><br/> When winter hits, we tend to go into hibernation,” says Richardo. “But given we are still facing so many challenges on the housing market, it might be a good idea for potential buyers to focus on the changes being made next year and to review their own personal situation as well. For example, if you don’t get a pay rise in 2026, you may be able to borrow slightly less than you thought.”</p><p><strong>Interest rate movements</strong><br/> Interest rates have gone down slightly throughout 2025 but the trend in the last quarter is up. “It’s not much but they have risen,” says Richardo. “We’re waiting on what the European Central Bank is going to do, but a cut does not necessarily mean banks will cut their mortgage interest rates as well.</p><p>“You can, however, get a discount on your mortgage rate at some banks if you buy a house with a good energy label, which also helps their own sustainability rating of course. I do expect interest rates to come down by around 0.5 percentage points across 2026.”</p><p><strong>Any questions?<br/> </strong>Expat Mortgages helps scores of clients each year with “complex” situations, and on January 15 is hosting an online seminar about entrepreneurs and mortgages. <a href="https://expatmortgages.nl/events/entrepreneurs-buying-a-house">Sign up here</a> or contact Expat Mortgages for advice on <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fexpatmortgages.nl%252Fcontact%26data%3D05%257C02%257Cwouter.Hofstee.holtrop%2540expatmortgages.nl%257Ca19197df80af439d668508de2e570030%257Cb13f947324684dd0923ee80d8f94602d%257C0%257C0%257C638999148601214892%257CUnknown%257CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%253D%253D%257C0%257C%257C%257C%26sdata%3DOlFLdPj6HIMAiY%252B57j6SYQTEcJMo4dTuhf8zScWF%252Bvc%253D%26reserved%3D0&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1765538668409000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2lqSLFHTqPZwRc4T1otG-b" href="https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexpatmortgages.nl%2Fcontact&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cwouter.Hofstee.holtrop%40expatmortgages.nl%7Ca19197df80af439d668508de2e570030%7Cb13f947324684dd0923ee80d8f94602d%7C0%7C0%7C638999148601214892%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=OlFLdPj6HIMAiY%2B57j6SYQTEcJMo4dTuhf8zScWF%2Bvc%3D&amp;reserved=0">your personal situation</a>.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/housing/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=261344</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 10:47:01 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>News, features, sport and art: The best of Dutch News in 2026</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/12/news-features-sport-and-art-the-best-of-dutch-news-in-2026/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-261634 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-art-and-culture category-election-2025 category-expats category-politics category-society category-sport"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> News, features, sport and art: The best of Dutch News in 2026</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2025-12-31T10:37:14+00:00"> December 31, 2025 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261635" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_261635"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="664" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-533736018.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-533736018.jpg 1000w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-533736018-560x372.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-533736018-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-533736018-768x510.jpg 768w" width="1000"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-261635"> Tall ships during the Sail In parade this summer.

You want to sell your house for the highest possible price, even if it takes many months. For the agent, however, while a higher price would increase his earnings slightly, it increases his cost a lot and he would be better off if he were to sell your house <em>quickly</em> at a lower price so they can get a slightly reduced commission and move on to the next client. Your interests are mostly aligned, but they aren’t <em>perfectly</em> aligned.</p><p>Now, bring that concept into my office.</p><p>As a financial adviser, I want to believe I always put your needs first. But the traditional business model of financial advice creates a severe principal agent problem.</p><p>The conflict of interest in the typical setup is as follows: an adviser is compensated the moment you agree to become a client. Whether through an upfront fee or a commission, the adviser gets paid immediately.</p><p>This creates a conflict. Onboarding a new client costs the adviser money (staff hours, compliance checks, and administration etc.). If the adviser were to conclude that, after some considerable investment of his time, “You don’t actually need an adviser right now,” he would lose money. Those costs now come with zero revenue.</p><p>But if he were to sign you up even though it were not in your best interest, he covers his costs and makes a profit instantly. In the traditional model, you can never be 100% certain that I or anyone else saying “yes” are doing so because it helps you, or simply because it pays me.</p><p>Breaking the cycle: I believe that to fix this misalignment of interests, we cannot just rely on promises, we have to change the maths. We must create a situation where putting <em>your</em> interests first is the only way to put <em>my</em> interests first.</p><p>That is why we are introducing a new way of doing business.</p><p>The core of this model is simple: The adviser must operate at a loss at the start of the relationship.</p><p>Under this model, we would not charge a large upfront fee that covers all my costs. Instead, the compensation is spread out over time. That would mean that when I spend hours building your financial plan and setting up your accounts, I am essentially investing my own money into our relationship. I am in the red.</p><p>In order for me to recoup my costs, I need to give you good advice and retain you as a client for a reasonable period of time.</p><p>Why this protects you</p><p>By taking on this financial risk, I change my own incentives:</p><ol><li>I cannot afford to give you bad advice. If I recommend a strategy that doesn’t work for you, you will leave. If you leave early, I don’t just lose future profit; I lose the money I spent setting you up as a client.</li><li>I will not onboard you if you don’t need me. If I don’t believe I can provide value to you for the long term, there’s no point in me taking you on as a client. It would be financial idiocy for me to sign you up, do the work, and have you leave in three months. Let’s hope I’m not <em>that</em> much of an idiot?</li></ol><p>Trust shouldn’t be something you have to hope for; it should be baked into the contract.</p><p>That is why Staden Financial Management is officially adopting this model. We are shifting the risk from you to us. We are confident that our advice provides real, long term value, and we are willing to put our own balance sheet on the line to prove it.</p><p>If we don’t deliver value, we don’t just lose a client. We lose money. And that is exactly how it should be.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.stadenfm.com/contact">Contact Luke Staden</a> of <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.stadenfm.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1736245966591000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1WvXKeP7G0CgKxc5DZJMts" href="https://www.stadenfm.com/">Staden Financial Management</a> to set up a meeting and discuss your particular financial needs or check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcS--jlIcox4ludV-ocigwA">YouTube channel</a>.</em></p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/financial-services/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=261672</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 10:18:55 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Customs chalk up record 60 tonne cannabis haul in 2025</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/12/customs-chalk-up-record-60-tonne-cannabis-haul-in-2025/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-261653 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-cannabis category-crime"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Customs chalk up record 60 tonne cannabis haul in 2025</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2025-12-31T09:59:43+00:00"> December 31, 2025 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-208998" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_208998"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="438" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ANP-460550646.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ANP-460550646.jpg 600w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ANP-460550646-560x409.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ANP-460550646-85x62.jpg 85w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ANP-460550646-130x95.jpg 130w" width="600"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-208998"> Customs officials during a demonstration at Tuesday's presentation.
