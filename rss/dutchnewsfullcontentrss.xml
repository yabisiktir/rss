if the US goes ahead.</p><h2>“Soft language”</h2><p>D66 leader and prospective prime minister Rob Jetten said the developments showed that the “soft language” used by European leaders in response to Trump had failed.</p><p>“It’s unprecedented for an American president to take such steps against his European allies, which is why it is good that Europe is saying unanimously that this is unacceptable,” Jetten said.</p><p>Henri Bontenbal, leader of the Christian Democrats (CDA), said it was “pretty ridiculous” that Trump was taking punitive measures against his country’s Nato allies and called the European response “sensible.”</p><p>“Europe is not lashing out verbally, but saying clearly what they think and that they are ready to take strong economic counter-measures.”</p><p>Dilan Yesilgöz of the VVD later gave her backing to her coalition partners, calling Trump’s threat to impose tariffs “very, very concerning and irresponsible.”</p><p>“We need each other in the world as allies,” she said, but she also expressed support for EU countermeasures to show that “we’re not going to roll over with our legs in the air.”</p></main><div
