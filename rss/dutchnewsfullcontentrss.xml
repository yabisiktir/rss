The website is loaded with tips for new arrivals on anything from buying a home to raising a child in the Netherlands.</p><p>Children in the Netherlands are allowed to do a limited amount of paid work from the age of 13, and to work legally from the age of 15, but they often have a bank account and a debit card before that.

The increase is particularly noticeable among children aged up to 14.</p><p data-end="735" data-start="494">The rise is steeper than at the same point last year, said Nivel researcher Mariëtte Hooiveld, but it is not unprecedented. “In 2023 the increase started even earlier, and in 2022 levels were roughly comparable to what we see now,” she said.</p><p data-end="735" data-start="494"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="955" data-start="737">In England, a mutated form of the H3N2 virus has led to what some have dubbed a “super flu”.

That isn’t the case.”</p><p data-end="2712" data-start="2482">Immunologist Ger Rijkers said it is inevitable the British virus will reach the Netherlands. “Viruses don’t respect borders,” he said.

In 2020, starters accounted for just 27% of home purchases.</p><p data-end="502" data-start="292">The increase is largely due to government measures aimed at improving access to the housing market, including the exemption from transfer tax and the introduction of buy-to-let restrictions, the Kadaster said.</p><p data-end="790" data-start="504">Another key factor is a sell-off wave by private landlords, who are disposing of their properties because tighter regulation has made renting less profitable.
