that could shift production or expertise abroad. China reacted angrily and <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/11/dutch-expect-nexperia-chip-exports-from-china-to-resume-soon/">temporarily halted deliveries</a> of crucial chips to European customers, including the car industry.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>The intervention followed what the minister described as “serious signals of governance shortcomings” at the Nijmegen-based company that could threaten European technological know-how and production capacity.</p><p>The company makes transistors in bulk which are used in European-manufactured cars, phones and solar panels.</p><p>Nexperia was also placed on a trade blacklist by the US government last year, around the time the case first came to court, but the Dutch government denied it had acted under pressure from Washington.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>In an earlier ruling, the court suspended Nexperia’s executive director, Zhang Xuezheng, appointed a former director who has a casting vote and placed the shares owned by Xueheng’s company Wingtech under administrative control.</p><p>Xuezheng has denied the allegations and is demanding €8 billion in damages for the Dutch government.

One set of rules resulted in the same wear and tear pattern as was found on the stone.”</p><p>The system may not have found the definitive rules, however, Roemer said. “When fed with a line pattern, Ludij will always find rules,” he said, “but that doesn’t mean the Romans played it in the exact same way.”</p><p>The aim of the game was probably to block the opponent’s tokens, a type of game that was played in the Middle Ages and which has now been found to date from much earlier times, Jeneson said.</p><p>The museum has provided a pdf version of the game which can be downloaded <a href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67cabb313a4e334994b1c5c7/6989be47f306c4d37531a159_Spelregels%20Romeins%20bordspel.pdf">here</a>.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/ai/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/gaming/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/limburg/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/society/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=263466</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 13:44:16 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Hanneke Sanou]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>The Netherlands needs more influencers from the United States</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/02/the-netherlands-needs-more-influencers-from-the-united-states/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-263457 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-expats category-social-media type-column newsletter-include"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> The Netherlands needs more influencers from the United States</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-02-11T13:36:38+00:00"> February 11, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-190854" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_190854"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="427" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_8785.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_8785.jpg 640w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_8785-560x374.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_8785-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_8785-92x62.jpg 92w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_8785-130x87.jpg 130w" width="640"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-190854"> Photo: DutchNews.nl</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Last month, Molly Quell asked in <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/01/an-influx-of-influencers/">her regular column</a> if the Netherlands can survive the onslaught of American influencers.
