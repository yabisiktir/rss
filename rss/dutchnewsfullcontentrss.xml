Asked if there was a point at which he would consider stepping aside, he snapped back: “No, that’s not going to happen”.</p><p>But with the atmosphere at the club growing restless, the decision may be taken out of his hands. Shortly before kick-off on Wednesday evening AFCA, the second largest Ajax supporters’ club, <a href="https://afcasc.nl/tijd-voor-een-nieuwe-trainer-met-ervaring/">released a statement</a> calling for Heitinga to be replaced.</p><p>Ten Hag, who led Ajax to the semi-final of the Champions League in 2019, is a free agent after being sacked by Bayer Leverkusen in August just three matches into his reign, though he has also been <a href="https://talksport.com/football/3702905/rob-edwards-next-wolves-manager-erik-ten-hag/">linked to the vacant manager’s job at English Premier League club Wolverhampton Wanderers</a>.</p><p>Heitinga has been at the helm since Francesco Farioli’s abrupt departure at the end of last season, but fans see his lack of experience as a first-team coach – he was previously assistant to Arne Slot at Liverpool – as evidence that the club lacks ambition.</p><h2>“Huge respect”</h2><p>AFCA said it had “huge respect for Johnny Heitinga as a player”, referring to the seven years he spent as a defender at the club between 2001 and 2008. “But we are judging him now as the coach of the Ajax first team,” they said.</p><p>“After 11 league matches, eight points behind [Feyenoord and PSV in the Eredivisie], the miserable performances in the Champions League and a style of football that’s enough to make you weep, the only conclusion we can come to is that Johnny is not the right head coach for Ajax. It’s time for a new coach with experience!”</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>Heitinga replied in the post-match press conference: “I haven’t seen the statement, but it’s obviously disappointing to hear. I’m a real son of this club, I’ll give my all for Ajax.”</p><p>To rub salt into the wounds, Farioli, the coach who took Ajax within a whisker of winning the league title last season, is back in the Netherlands with his new club, Porto, who are playing Utrecht in the Europa League.</p><h2>Farioli keeps counsel</h2><p>Porto are top of their domestic league with nine wins from 10 games and in contention to progress in Europe’s second-tier competition. But the Italian deflected questions about whether the fans’ growing appreciation of his achievements since Heitinga took over made him feel proud.</p><p>“What would have made me feel proud was giving the title back to Ajax,” <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2589356-farioli-koestert-herinneringen-aan-ajax-maar-was-pas-trots-geweest-met-landstitel">he said</a>. “But unfortunately it wasn’t possible.</p><p>“I’m watching the games as a supporter from a distance,” Farioli said when asked his former club’s current predicament. “I don’t think it’s kind to comment.”</p><p>Ajax have a chance of salvaging some pride in their next Champions League match on November 25 when they take on Benfica, the only other team with no points from their opening four games. The question is whether Heitinga will still be in a position to take advantage.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/football/ajax/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/football/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/sport/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=259630</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 14:38:36 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Gordon Darroch]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Court throws out lawsuit aiming to stop arms exports to Israel</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/11/court-throws-out-lawsuit-aiming-to-stop-arms-exports-to-israel/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-259624 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-court-cases category-gaza category-israel newsletter-include"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Court throws out lawsuit aiming to stop arms exports to Israel</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2025-11-06T14:22:26+00:00"> November 6, 2025 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-62741" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_62741"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="282" sizes="(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/court-justice.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/court-justice.jpg 424w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/court-justice-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/court-justice-300x200.jpg 300w" width="424"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-62741"> Photo: Despositphotos.com</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><p>The Hague Court of Appeal on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit brought by a group of NGOs aiming to force the Dutch government to stop weapons exports to Israel.</p><p>The complaint, filed last year, said the Netherlands violated international law by continuing to support Israel during its war on Gaza.

announced by the European Commission to accelerate the development of a high-speed rail network linking European cities.</p><p>Train users have long complained about the lack of oversight in the European high speed train network and the commission says it now wants to give passengers “a real alternative to short-haul flights and long car journeys”.</p><p>The EU has plans to “double high-speed rail traffic by 2030 compared to 2015 and triple it by 2050”.</p><p>Under the new plan, the commission says it intends to work with member states to develop a network that will cut travel time for many popular journeys by half and open the market to new entrants.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex

to Lisbon in three instead of nine, and from Munich to Rome in six instead of 9.5, the commission said. Travel time from Amsterdam to Berlin will be reduced marginally to 5.5 hours, according to the initiative.</p><p>The development of the high-speed network will benefit especially central and eastern Europe, which to date is poorly connected, the commission said.</p><p>“The “high-speed rail is not just about cutting travel times, it is about uniting Europeans, strengthening our economy, and leading the global race for sustainable transport…”</p><p>The commission also aims to ensure better links between high-speed rail and other transport modes, connecting long-distance trains to all EU airports handling over 12 million passengers by 2030.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>Part of the plan involves making it easier to purchase cross-border tickets involving several operators.

Was a reader upset about something I’d written for Dutch News? Had I cut ahead of someone in the checkout line at Albert Heijn or failed to wipe down the handles on a treadmill at the gym?</p><p>Instead of contacting the authorities, I discussed the situation with my partner and finally opted to open the envelope in our garden to be on the safe side. It had just been Halloween after all.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>Every October, we fill our front windows with Halloween decorations. We put up holographic paintings similar to the ones at Phantom Manor at Disneyland Paris, a life-sized raven, a cheeky <em>Beetlejuice</em> poster, and lots of fake cobwebs.</p><p>The display, which is more humorous than horrifying, attracts a fair amount of attention. I actually keep a tally of the number of fascinated kids and begrudging parents who visit our ghoulish gallery.</p><p>International students who may have never encountered a Halloween display even sometimes stop to take photos. One girl was out there for ten minutes last week snapping selfies and photographing every single detail.</p><p>But there’s also more than a few older Dutch people who stop to sneer and shake their heads.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>The envelope wasn’t stuffed full of arsenic, nor was it a ‘glitter bomb.’ Instead, it contained a lovingly crafted painting of a paper lantern alongside song lyrics.

And would doing so give them the impression they’ve won a minor victory in the ongoing clash between these two holidays?</p><p>We discussed the painting with a few friends, one of whom theorised the culprit is a retired art teacher with nothing better to do than pester people with editorialised paintings. Another suggested we hang it in one of the windows with a Sint-Maarten lantern and see if they show up on the night of November 11.</p><p>At the time of this writing, we haven’t made a decision, but there is another option we’re mulling over since we haven’t taken down the display yet.</p><p>We might stick little Santa hats on all of our Halloween ghosts and ghouls and keep them in the windows well past New Year.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" href="/life-in-the-netherlands/column/"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/society/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=259525</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 07:55:15 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Brandon Hartley]]></dc:creator></item></channel></rss>
