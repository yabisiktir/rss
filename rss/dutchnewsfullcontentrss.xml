Bowler Kyle Klein spoke to Dutch News ahead of the game.</strong></p><p>There is a boisterous energy to everything Kyle Klein brings to the cricket field and even off it. You notice it straight away as white balls ping out of the training nets in Colombo, the venue for the Netherlands’ T20 World Cup opener against Pakistan on Saturday.</p><p>On the pitch, he takes it into another gear. He digs them into the pitch at high speeds, gets them to skid off it faster and has batters contorting into awkward positions. He bounces them out, nicks them off and clean bowls them often with a game-changing spell.</p><p>Then there’s the one-handed screamers at short midwicket.</p><p>“He reminds me of Marnus Labuschagne (Australian top-order batter),” Max O’Dowd laughs when asked about the 24-year-old HBS quick. “He knows everything about cricket and he’s one of the biggest cricket nuffies I’ve met.”</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>Why’s that? “I love cricket, to be honest. And I do know lots of stats and lots of weird things about cricket,” Klein explains in a chat with Dutch News.</p><p>“I really looked up to Marnus when I was finishing high school and he was doing well, but the nuffy-ness level has gone down a bit.”</p><p>Ryan van Niekerk, the team’s bowling coach, offers a different perspective: “Because he’s a nuffy, it wasn’t too difficult to get a guy like him to buy into certain things to improve on.”</p><p>Van Niekerk would know. He has coached Klein since he was playing school cricket for Rondebosch High School in Cape Town, where the Gary Kirsten Academy is now situated.</p><p>Having never seriously considered playing professionally, Klein only picked up the game seven years ago, when he moved to the Netherlands, where both his grandparents grew up. His brother – Ryan – has already won 22 caps for the Dutch.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>Klein spends the summers in the Netherlands playing for HBS Craeyenhout in the Hague, and flies back home during the winter to play for the Western Province Cricket Club in Cape Town. It helps that the Gary Kirsten Academy is only around the corner which allows him access to the nets and a gym.</p><p>Since his maiden ODI call-up for the South Africa tour in 2023, Klein has been a part of every touring party – even going to India for the ODI World Cup as a development player on the KNCB’s tab. As a result, he became au fait with the language in the dressing room and two years in, he has fitted seamlessly into the team’s plans.</p><p>Since his debut in Nepal two years ago, he has exclusively sat in the fast lane, being the leading wicket-taker for the side across ODIs and T20Is and has quickly become Scott Edwards’ go-to with the ball.</p><p>“Scotty’s got this thing where he’ll give us the ball personally, between overs, and he’ll ask me to get a wicket,” Klein says.</p><h2>Model</h2><p>“My evolution came when he said we need a guy in the team that can take wickets throughout the innings and I try to model my game off of that. I’ve bowled to him a lot, so he just gives me constant feedback on what feels difficult to face and off the field, he has got a great balance between being a friend, a captain, and someone you can be vulnerable with.”</p><p>Klein cuts a relaxed figure ahead of his World Cup debut, having just finished a game of Catan with his teammates before jumping on the call. It helps to have a clarity in where his strengths lie: bowling in the powerplay and keeping the stumps in play. He is currently working on how to construct a perfect over, pushing the speed gun higher and being a consistent threat for the batters.</p><p>“He has really invested in himself and it’s phenomenal when a young player decides to take ownership saying, ‘listen, I need to change my lifestyle’ so he doesn’t drink alcohol, and he eats extremely healthily,” Van Niekerk adds.</p><p>“He understands his body and what it needs. That combined with an ability to really study technical nuances, and sit with me on the laptop and look at thousands of videos.”</p><h2>Bowling attack</h2><p>Klein has had a taste of the biggest stage but none would come close to the challenge of leading a bowling attack against the likes of Pakistan in Colombo, Namibia in Delhi, the USA in Chennai, and India in Ahmedabad at the biggest stadium in the world.</p><p>“This is kind of what you train all year for. The nerves will be there, but trying to not get too fixated on it. Whatever happens, happens.</p><p>“I think this is the best the Netherlands team has ever been. We have got 15 guys who can all fit into the team epitomise Ryan Cook’s Total cricket. We will try to make it to the semis but we really want to enjoy it.”</p><p><em>All of the Netherlands’ matches will be live streamed on NOS. </em></p><p><em>Schedule:</em></p><p>February 7 – Pakistan vs Netherlands – SSC Colombo (11am local time/6:30am CEST)</p><p><em>February 10 – Netherlands vs Namibia – Delhi (11am local time/6:30am CEST) </em></p><p><em>February 13 – Netherlands vs USA – Chennai (7pm local time/2:30pm CEST)</em></p><p><em>February 18 – India vs Netherlands – Ahmedabad (7pm local time/2:30pm CEST)</em></p><p><em> </em></p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/cricket-2/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/sport/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=263307</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 08:04:07 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Malhar Hathi]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Dutch central bank urges targeted use of extra defence billions</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/02/dutch-central-bank-urges-targeted-use-of-extra-defence-billions/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-263303 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-armed-forces category-defence category-dnb category-nato newsletter-top-article"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Dutch central bank urges targeted use of extra defence billions</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-02-06T15:05:53+00:00"> February 6, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-192836" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_192836"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="385" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/air-defence.png" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/air-defence.png 600w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/air-defence-560x359.png 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/air-defence-92x59.png 92w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/air-defence-130x83.png 130w" width="600"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-192836"> Photo: Ministry of Defence</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><p data-end="315" data-start="81">The Netherlands will spend more than €19 billion extra on defence each year in the long term, but those funds should be deployed strategically to strengthen areas where the country already has an edge, the <a href="https://www.dnb.nl/algemeen-nieuws/nieuws-2026/zet-extra-defensiemiljarden-gericht-in-voor-grootste-strategisch-voordeel/">Dutch central bank</a> said on Friday.</p><p data-end="639" data-start="317">The bank said the greatest economic and strategic return would come from focusing on so-called dual-use technologies – military products that also have civilian applications.</p><p data-end="847" data-start="641">The Netherlands has committed to spending at least 3.5% of GDP on defence within 10 years.

There is a lack of people to do the jobs,” union official Jan Kampherbeek told the programme.</p><p>The Ibis Styles hotel is part of hotel chain Novum Hospitality, which has 130 hotels, mostly in Germany. It said the issue is a matter for cleaning company Ö&amp;I Clean Group GmbH which in turn pointed the finger at subcontracted cleaning company AHR Clean UG.</p><h2>Permits</h2><p>AHR Clean said they were in the process of getting a work permit for some of the workers but that these were taking too long. According to Ensing, companies are using “complicated routes on purpose to make fraudulent practices easier. “Everybody is pointing the finger at someone else”, she said.</p><p>Some of the cleaners, who live at refugee accommodation in Arnhem, have been paid after inquiries made by Nieuwsuur but many are still waiting for their money.</p><p>The case is similar to that of a group of cleaners working illegally for a <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/10/officials-dismiss-human-trafficking-case-against-amsterdam-gym/">gym in Amsterdam</a>, although there the accusations of human

Here’s what the Dutch team are hoping to achieve.</strong></p><p>If you’ve never watched a Winter Olympics in the Netherlands before, it can feel like stepping into a two-dimensional parallel universe.</p><p>While the rest of the world is enthralled by athletes hurtling down mountainsides on skis, in bobsleighs and on the terrifying tea-trays of luge, the Dutch prefer to keep things on the level and indulge in their national obsession with speed skating.</p><p>For two and a half weeks, <a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/schedule">starting from the opening ceremony on February 6</a>, names such as Femke Kok, Jenning de Boo, Kjeld Nuis and Jutta Leerdam will fuel conversations in households, on talk shows and around water coolers.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>Beanie-hatted commentators will talk animatedly about crossovers, lane changes and whether the ice is faster after the <em>dweil</em>, when the rink is swept clear of debris halfway through the programme.</p><p>At some point someone will bring up the time four-time Olympic champion Sven Kramer missed out on a fifth gold when he was <a href="https://nos.nl/video/2596541-reconstructie-de-fatale-wissel-van-sven-kramer-in-2010">disqualified for skating in the wrong lane</a> because of a mix-up by his coach.</p><p>Seven out of 10 people in the Netherlands <a href="https://tvvisie.nl/nieuws/nederland/26februari2022/kijkcijfers-7-op-10-nederlanders-beleven-winterspelen-bij-nos_113822/">tuned in to NOS’s coverage of the last Winter Games in Beijing</a>, watching an average of nine hours each – despite a seven-hour time difference.</p><h2>Schouten treble</h2><p>The high point was Irene Schouten’s triumph in the women’s 3000m, the first of her three gold medals, when 1.7 million people cheered on the 29-year-old from their living-rooms and breakfast tables on a Saturday morning.</p><p>The Netherlands came away from Beijing with six gold medals on the ice, including three for Schouten, four silvers and two bronzes.</p><p>This year 18 of <a href="https://www.teamnl.org/artikelen/2025/12/deelnemers-nederland-olympische-winterspelen-milaan">the 39 Dutch athletes in Milan</a> will be speed skaters, with another nine hoping to win medals in the kamikaze condensed version known as short track. Suzanne Schulting, a triple Olympic champion on the short oval, will feature in both.</p><p>Die-hard skating fan Johan van Buren, who is heading to his sixth Olympics, said: “The atmosphere during a skating event is always fantastic. It’s all about performance and the fans cheer on every skater, not just those from their own country.”</p><h2>Kok hot favourite</h2><p>The Dutch squad for Milan is once again packed with gold medal contenders, but the strongest favourite is Femke Kok in the women’s sprints.</p><p>The 25-year-old from Opsterland <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2590745-kok-verpulvert-wereldrecord-500-meter-in-salt-lake-tot-36-09-hoe-kan-dit">set a new world record for 500m of 36.09 seconds in November</a>, taking a quarter of a second off a mark that had stood for 12 years, and is unbeaten in her last 23 races at the shortest distance.</p><p>Kok is also going in the 1,000 and 1,500 metres, where she will face competition from her team-mates, Jutta Leerdam and Antoinette De Jong.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>Leerdam is better known outside the Netherlands as the fiancé of YouTube personality turned boxer Jake Paul and boasts <a href="https://www.instagram.com/juttaleerdam/">a 5 million-strong Instagram following</a>, but her record on the ice is even more impressive.</p><p>She won a silver medal at 1,000m in Beijing and will be hoping to go one better as she tries to add an Olympic title to her collection of 13 world and European gold medals.</p><h2>Takagi threat</h2><p>Their biggest rival for gold is the Japanese defending champion <a href="https://www.eurosport.nl/schaatsen/milaan-cortina-2026/2026/maak-kennis-met-miho-takagi-japanse-wil-jutta-leerdam-en-femke-kok-van-goud-afhouden_vid60050438/video.shtml">Miho Takagi</a>, who began her quest for a third Olympic gold with a six-week training camp <a href="https://nos.nl/video/2590380-japanse-topschaatsster-takagi-slijpt-op-nederlands-vakantiepark-aan-olympische-vorm">on a holiday park in Noord-Holland</a>.</p><p>De Jong took bronze over 3,000m in Pyeongchang eight years ago and 1,500 in Beijing. This year she is concentrating on the shorter distance, while world champion Joy Beune missed out on a place as she could only finish fourth at the Dutch national trials.</p><p>Beune, who has won four of the five world cup rounds over her favourite distance, will be looking to make amends at the 3,000m. Marijke Groenewoud is competing in both the longer distances, but her best chance of gold is in the mass start, where she is a double world champion.</p><h2>Versatile Schulting</h2><p>Suzanne Schulting will also contest the 1,000m as she tries to become the first man or woman to win Olympic titles on the big oval and at shorttrack.</p><p>She will <a href="https://www.nu.nl/olympische-spelen/6384370/schulting-mag-olympische-shorttracktitel-op-1000-meter-niet-verdedigen-in-milaan.html">not be going for a third shorttrack gold over 1,000 metres</a>, however, after the selectors opted for the Velzenboer sisters, Xandra and Michelle, and Selma Poutsma. Schulting’s only individual outing at shorttrack will be over 1,500m, where she won bronze four years ago.</p><p>Xandra Velzenboer is a former world champion over 500m and 1,000m, while Michelle is reigning Dutch champion over all three individual disciplines.</p><h2>Nuis controversy</h2><p>In the men’s long track events, veteran Kjeld Nuis will be hoping to close out his illustrious career with a fourth Olympic title.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.rtl.nl/nieuws/binnenland/artikel/5549803/kjeld-nuis-rijdt-toch-de-1500-meter-milaan-tim-prins-gaat-niet">selection of the 36-year-old for the 1,500m was shrouded in controversy</a> after Tim Prins pipped him to third place at this year’s national championships, which act as the Olympic trials.</p><p>But the selectors picked Nuis, who won gold at the distance in Pyeongchang and Beijing and holds the world record from 2019, because Olympic rules only allow a maximum of nine men and nine women per country, and the Dutch wanted to include Marcel Bosker in the team pursuit trio.</p><p>Nuis has also qualified for the 1,000m, which he won in 2018, while Prins was left to console himself with <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2597394-na-fastfood-en-korte-nachten-staat-teleurgestelde-prins-weer-op-het-ijs-voor-ek-afstanden">a junk food blowout</a> and a long ride on his mountain bike.</p><p>Joep Wennemars <a href="https://nos.nl/liveblog/2596495-okt-eindigt-met-schaatsrelletje-tussen-wennemars-en-nuis-tweede-matrix-ingevuld">won the 1,500m at the trials</a> and is also competing in the 500m and 1,000m, while Jenning de Boo will need to rediscover his early season form if he wants to get among the medals over the shorter distances.</p><p>But both will have to overcome <a href="https://sportnieuws.nl/schaatsen/nieuws/nederlandse-topschaatsers-moeten-oppassen-tijdens-olympische-winterspelen-dit-zijn-de-gevaarlijke-concurrenten-2026013016284773836/">the American favourite Jordan Stolz</a>. The 21-year-old has been in imposing form this season, winning 15 out of 19 World Cup races across the three sprints, and could try for five gold medals in Milan.</p><p>Jorrit Bergsma will line up in the 10,000m and mass start a week after celebrating his 40<sup>th</sup> birthday and three months after he became the oldest ever Dutch national champion over the distance. The champion from 2014 will have his work cut out to get among the medals this time.</p><h2>Skeleton Bos</h2><p>On the shorttrack arena, Jens van ’t Wout, who will <a href="https://www.nu.nl/olympische-spelen/6381618/jens-van-t-wout-en-kimberley-bos-vlaggendragers-bij-openingsceremonie-spelen.html">carry the team’s flag</a> at the opening ceremony, is among the favourites in all three individual events. He will be joined by his brother Melle, Teun Boer, Itzhak de Laat and Friso Emons.</p><p>Dutch hopes are not entirely confined to the skating events. Kimberley Bos, the other team flag carrier, made history in Beijing as the first Dutch medallist away from the ice rink when she won bronze in skeleton bob.</p><p>The 32-year-old from Ede will be hoping to be on the podium again in Milan, but her best World Cup result so far this year is a fourth place in Altenberg.</p><p>The Dutch are also sending a figure skating pair to the Olympics for the first time, in the shape of Michel Tsiba and Russian-born Daria Danilova, as well as two-man and four-man men’s bobsleigh teams.</p><p>Melissa Peperkamp <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2600107-o-wacht-ik-ben-mijn-board-vergeten-een-dag-met-olympisch-snowboarder-peperkamp">is the Netherlands’ best hope for a medal in the snowboarding events</a>, where she is joined by Romy van Vreden, Michelle Dekker and Glenn de Blois.</p><p>But hopes of an unlikely Dutch medal in downhill skiing were crushed when the former giant slalom champion Marcel Hirscher, who used to compete for Austria but switched allegiance to the Netherlands two years ago, <a href="https://www.nu.nl/sport-overig/6382052/skilegende-hirscher-niet-namens-nederland-naar-spelen-ben-niet-op-topniveau.html">was unable to recover from a series of injuries</a>.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/olympics/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/skating/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/sport/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=263262</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 07:20:19 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Gordon Darroch]]></dc:creator></item></channel></rss>
