after completing their mission.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.defensie.nl/actueel/nieuws/2026/01/19/nederlandse-verkenning-groenland-afgerond">ministry of defence said</a> the duo had been sent to prepare the ground for a possible future military exercise by European nations.</p><p>“During the next phase the preparatory work will be continued from Denmark and the Netherlands,” the ministry said in a statement.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center

by European leaders.</p><p>Last week defence minister Ruben Brekelmans said one naval officer would go to Greenland, along with colleagues from France, Germany, the UK and Scandinavian nations, to prepare for an exercise known as Arctic Endurance.</p><h2>Arctic Sentry</h2><p>The Netherlands later added a second officer to the mission and said it could be followed by a more substantial Nato operation under the name Arctic Sentry. “The Dutch officers contributed operational as well as logistical expertise,” the defence ministry said.</p><p>The reconnaissance mission followed a statement by a number of European nations declaring their support for Greenland’s status as an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark.</p><p>The Netherlands was not among the signatories, but caretaker prime minister Dick Schoof said he supported the declaration.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex

25% from June 1 if Denmark refused to sell the island.</p><p>The parties in the incoming Dutch coalition condemned Trump’s stance and supported the European Union’s plans to take retaliatory measures if the US goes ahead.</p><h2>“Soft language”</h2><p>D66 leader and prospective prime minister Rob Jetten said the developments showed that the “soft language” used by European leaders in response to Trump had failed.</p><p>“It’s unprecedented for an American president to take such steps against his European allies, which is why it is good that Europe is saying unanimously that this is unacceptable,” Jetten said.</p><p>Henri Bontenbal, leader of the Christian Democrats (CDA), said it was “pretty ridiculous” that Trump was taking punitive measures against his country’s Nato allies and called the European response “sensible.”</p><p>“Europe is not lashing out verbally, but saying clearly what they think and that they are ready to take strong economic counter-measures.”</p><p>Dilan Yesilgöz of the VVD later gave her backing to her coalition partners, calling Trump’s threat to impose tariffs “very, very concerning and irresponsible.”</p><p>“We need each other in the world as allies,” she said, but she also expressed support for EU countermeasures to show that “we’re not going to roll over with our legs in the air.”</p></main><div
