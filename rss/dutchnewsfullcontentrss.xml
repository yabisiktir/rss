Here is a round-up of the main controversies affecting people’s pockets.</p><p data-end="418" data-start="229"><strong>Social security</strong><br data-end="247" data-start="244"/>The biggest change planned for the social security system is to halve the length of time people who lose their jobs can claim unemployment benefit, from two years to one.</p><p data-end="929" data-start="420">People claiming WW would get 80% of their former salary for two months, rather than 70%, and then 70% for the rest of the period.

The Dutch average retirement age is now the second highest in Europe.</p><p data-end="2106" data-start="1878">The unions have already criticised the proposal, describing it as unfair to people now approaching retirement age who have worked hard their entire lives. They also point to the impact on people doing physically demanding work.</p><p data-end="2354" data-start="2108">There is, however, one advantage for the Netherlands’ foreign residents. To qualify for a full state pension, you must have lived in the country for 50 years, and this will give international workers a little more time to build up pension rights.</p><p data-end="2354" data-start="2108"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="2541" data-start="2356"><strong>Healthcare</strong><br data-end="2369" data-start="2366"/>The cabinet wants to save €10 billion a year on healthcare, and this is likely to be one of the most controversial issues facing the new administration.</p><p data-end="2844" data-start="2543">Of this, €6 billion will come from increasing the own-risk element in health insurance from €385 to €460 in 2027 and then increasing it in line with inflation.

though the new coalition of D66, VVD and CDA included them in its programme for government.</p><p>The plans include limiting residency permits to three years, creating a two-tier system for refugees, and making it a crime to live in the Netherlands without legal status.</p><p>While in opposition D66 was one of the fiercest critics of the plans, introduced by former asylum minister Marjolein Faber of the far-right PVV party.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center

style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>But the incoming coalition has said it wants to push the laws through to avoid further delays to reforming the asylum system.</p><p>“We’re not fans of it, but sometimes you have to go the extra mile,” D66 leader and prospective prime minister Rob Jetten told Nieuwsuur last week. “The Netherlands needs clarity when it comes to asylum policy.”</p><p>But D66 senator and asylum spokesman Boris Dittrich said the party’s seven members in the upper house were still opposed to the plans. “The Senate is not bound by the coalition agreement,” <a href="https://www.trouw.nl/politiek/d66-stemt-in-de-senaat-tegen-de-twee-asielwetten-uit-het-coalitieakkoord~bf547e87/">he told Trouw</a>.</p><p>Dittrich said his objections to making illegal residence a criminal offence were unchanged. “It’s inhumane to punish people who don’t possess the right papers,” he said, adding that other laws were available to deal with illegal immigrants who cause problems for society.</p><h2>Soup clause</h2><p>The clause was one of the most controversial aspects of the proposed law, after the PVV managed to pass an amendment that would have made it an offence to assist illegal asylum seekers in any way.</p><p>D66, coalition partner CDA and the smaller Christian parties CU and SGP threatened to vote against the law on the grounds that it could criminalise acts of charity such as offering a bowl of soup to a homeless refugee.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100

“novelle”, a guidance note stating that helping asylum seekers would not be treated as an offence.</p><p>Dittrich said the D66 senators were also critical of the two-status model, under which would mean people who are directly threatened by their governments receive an “A” status and a better chance of being granted asylum, while those fleeing because of the conditions in their country would receive a “B” status.</p><p>The system was abandoned in the Netherlands in 2000 because it prompted a mass of legal challenges by asylum seekers on the “B” list.</p><p>“A lot of people with a B status challenged it in the hope of securing an A status, ” Dittrich said. “A lot of them ended up being allowed to stay. We don’t want to make that distinction.”</p><p>If D66 votes against the laws in the upper house, the other two coalition partners VVD and CDA could still count on the support of the farmers’ party BBB and the right-wing JA21. But they will still need to find another nine votes, which could potentially be provided by the PVV, the far-right FVD and the CU.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/asylum/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/d66/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/election-2025/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/politics/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=263101</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 08:51:46 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Gordon Darroch]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Dutch housing shortage grows as investors turn their backs</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/02/dutch-housing-shortage-grows-as-investors-turn-their-backs/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-263104 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-construction category-house-prices category-housing category-real-estate category-rental-housing newsletter-top-article"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Dutch housing shortage grows as investors turn their backs</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-02-03T08:44:20+00:00"> February 3, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-251315" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_251315"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="1512" sizes="(max-width: 2016px) 100vw, 2016px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9226.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9226.jpg 2016w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9226-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9226-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9226-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9226-1536x1152.jpg 1536w" width="2016"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-251315"> Photo: Dutch News</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><p data-end="359" data-start="142">The shortage of housing in the Netherlands has now <a href="https://www.capitalvalue.nl/insights/voorraad-huurwoningen-krimpt/">stretched to 410,000</a>, and more investment in rental properties is becoming increasingly urgent, according to a new report by real estate advisory group Capital Value.</p><p data-end="510" data-start="361">The number of households in the Netherlands has expanded by 80,000, but the size of the housing stock has only gone up by 70,000, Capital Value said.</p><p data-end="759" data-start="512">The outgoing cabinet had a target of 100,000 new homes a year, and that has been adopted by the incoming administration.

National climate policy is thin, the paper argues, with an emphasis on subsidies, carbon capture and storage and plans for “at least four” new nuclear power stations — all VVD and CDA priorities. Measures such as a national CO₂ levy for industry and stricter targets have been dropped.</p><p data-end="1365" data-start="1013">On migration and nitrogen policy, the paper argues that D66 again moved towards its partners, accepting tougher asylum policies and weaker nitrogen targets and timelines. D66 gains, according to the Volkskrant, are limited, with the agreement containing only “relatively small amounts” for education, the rule of law, media and development cooperation.</p><p data-end="1365" data-start="1013"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="2778" data-start="2439">According to the <a href="https://fd.nl/politiek/1585262/voor-de-oppositie-moeten-de-onderhandelingen-nog-beginnen">Financieele Dagblad,</a> “the negotiations are only just beginning” for the opposition parties that will be needed to steer new legislation through parliament. The coalition agreement, the FD says, can be seen as an opening bid, with key opposition parties already positioning themselves ahead of talks on individual measures.</p><p data-end="3166" data-start="2780">GroenLinks-PvdA leader <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/02/klaver-demands-drastic-changes-to-coalitions-spending-cuts/">Jesse Klaver has called the deal</a> “the starting point for negotiations” and insisted that his party will only offer support in return for a “fundamental change of course”. He was particularly critical of planned cuts to healthcare and social security and of the decision to speed up the rise in the state pension age, which he said undermines long-term agreements.</p><p data-end="3414" data-start="3168">The paper says the minority cabinet will have to rely heavily on deal-making in parliament and points to a central role for CDA leader Henri Bontenbal, who is staying on as parliamentary leader, where much of the political wrangling will be done.</p><h2 data-end="3414" data-start="3168">Coalition resistance</h2><p data-end="3758" data-start="3416"><a href="https://www.telegraaf.nl/politiek/oppositie-slijpt-de-messen-breed-verzet-tegen-bezuinigingen-nieuw-kabinet/128059486.html">The Telegraaf</a> focuses on mounting resistance to the coalition’s cuts, saying the opposition is “sharpening its knives” ahead of the parliamentary debate on Tuesday. During that debate, parties will try to establish whether there is any appetite to back measures such as a faster rise in the state pension age or cuts to unemployment benefits.</p><p data-end="4132" data-start="3760">Klaver has already said he wants to see a “fundamental change of course”, and other parties have also flagged their own red lines, the paper says. The BBB, for example, opposes cuts to healthcare and parts of the climate and nitrogen strategy, while several parties, including the ChristenUnie, see the pension age increase as a major problem.</p><p data-end="4428" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="" data-start="4134">The Telegraaf also reports that opposition parties are trying to avoid being played off against each other. Jan Struijs, leader of the one-man party 50Plus, says that “finding friends and forming coalitions will be our core business”, and the paper concludes that the real test will come later when the coalition’s first budget is published in September.</p><p data-end="4428" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="" data-start="4134">MPs will debate the coalition agreement on Tuesday, with Klaver, as leader of the biggest opposition party, kicking off the proceedings.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/politics/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=263096</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:45:33 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item></channel></rss>
