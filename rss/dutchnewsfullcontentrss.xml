Thousands of passengers are left in limbo as Schiphol airport battles with snowbound runways and a shortage of de-icing fluid. Talks to form a new government are given an added sense of urgency by events in Venezuela. The Giant is cut down to size by the Nuke in his quest to become the third Dutch darts world champion.

According to Wiebe Wieling, former chairman of <a href="https://elfstedentocht.frl/en/">the association</a> charged with organising the legendary ice skating race, climate change could sound its death knell.</p><p>Wieling, the fourth chairman in history who did not run a single tour, said that a week of snow was actually terrible news if you want thick ice.</p><p>“If there’s snow, there’s no ice, so there will be no Elfstedentocht,” he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/09/climate-netherlands-snow-dutch-transport-infrastructure-chaos">said</a>.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>The race, which was last held in 1997, can only go ahead if there is a minimum ice thickness of 15cm across the whole route – something that has happened 15 times since 1909. But <a href="https://www.knmi.nl/over-het-knmi/nieuws/jaaroverzicht-weer-2024">the weather is warming</a> so rapidly that the chances are ever smaller, and 2024 was another <a href="https://cdn.knmi.nl/system/data_center_publications/files/000/072/295/original/KNMI-publicatie_25-01.pdf">record-breaking year</a>.</p><p>“In 2012 there was almost enough for an edition but we had only 7cm to 8cm of ice in the south,” said Wieling. “Snow is terrible for ice. This weather is very bad news.”</p><p>In a cold snap that is not yet over, thousands of flights, bus services and trains have been cancelled, some municipalities have been criticised for failing to clear bike lanes and paths, and several flat roofs have collapsed under the weight of snow.</p><p><strong>Hope</strong></p><p>Hylke de Vries, climate scientist at the KNMI meteorological institute, said that much has to do with the wind in a country that has relatively mild winter temperatures because of the nearby North Sea. “It only gets bitterly cold if the wind turns northeast in winter,” he said.</p><p>“That usually means blue skies and very cold, icy conditions, and that may persist for a couple of weeks and then we can skate on the ice and everybody starts to hope for Elfstedentocht.”</p><p>But, he said, when the wind comes from the north or northwest, that can bring snow. “Only when the wind turns northerly, we get also this moisture coming in from the evaporating North Sea that might end up – if the upper air is cold enough – as snow in our region,” he said. “Unlike regions that are dominated by continental air flows, where snow is inevitable, here, we have to have it cold enough in the upper air and still moist enough to produce snow showers.”</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-262028" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_262028" style="width: 560px"><noscript><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-262028" decoding="async" height="420" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-05-09.48.34-560x420.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-05-09.48.34-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-05-09.48.34-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-05-09.48.34-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-05-09.48.34-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-05-09.48.34-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" width="560"/></noscript><img alt="" class="lazyload size-medium wp-image-262028" data-sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" data-src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-05-09.48.34-560x420.jpg" data-srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-05-09.48.34-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-05-09.48.34-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-05-09.48.34-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-05-09.48.34-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-05-09.48.34-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" decoding="async" height="420" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20560%20420%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="560"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-262028">“Snow is the enemy of ice” Photo: S Boztas</figcaption></figure><p>According to the KNMI, in 1961, there was snow cover at De Bilt weather station for an average of 23 days a year, but now it is just three.

This time, Washington will combine negotiation and pressure to force interim president Decly Rodríguez to come to economic cooperation, the release of prisoners and democratic elections.</p><p>“That is what I have been told and what I want to share with you in all openness,” Van Weel said.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>Talks with Rodriguez are ongoing, and the EU wants to play a role in them, he said. “As European countries, we want to focus on things where we can have an effect, such as the release of political prisoners and contacts with the opposition,” he said.</p><p>A minority of MPs wanted a strongly worded public condemnation of the US actions. Denk leader Stephan van Baarle called US president Trump “a dangerous despot” while Volt MP Laurens Dassen accused him of “imperialist power politics”.</p><p>GroenLinks-PvdA MP Tom van der Lee said the intervention in Venezuela will encourage Russia and China to do whatever they want and future government party D66 also said “the attack should be labelled a breach of international law”.</p><p>Nevertheless, a majority of MPs supported Van Weel’s approach, with CDA MP Derk Boswijk favouring “not treading the moral high ground but not being without criticism either”. Potential coalition partner JA21 said there is “no place for emotional or ideological wishful thinking, only realism”. <strong> </strong></p><p>VVD MP Eric van der Burg said any sanctions against the US would be “unacceptable”. “We chose to be completely dependent on Chinese products and on the US for our defense because it’s cheaper.

players over a 23-year-period, which is expected to trigger billions of euros in compensation payments.</p><p>It follows a case brought by Lassana Diarra, a former France international player, who took FIFA to court when its rules prevented him from joining Belgian club Charleroi from Lokomotiv Moscow in 2015.</p><p>The case ended up being referred to the European Union’s Court of Justice, which ruled in October last year that FIFA’s transfer regulations breached the player’s rights to freedom of movement under EU law.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none

Players, told Dutch News that the onus was now on FIFA to reform the system and compensate players for lost earnings since the current rules were introduced in 2002.</p><p>The group has filed its claim with the Midden-Nederland district court under the <a href="https://www.cliffordchance.com/insights/resources/blogs/group-litigation-and-class-actions/2025/02/five-years-of-the-dutch-class-action-act.html">Dutch Mass Claims Settlement Act (WAMCA)</a> against FIFA and nine European national football associations, including France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark.</p><p>Discussions have begun to settle the case, but Melcherts said the group was ready to go to court if necessary. “We have had exploratory talks, but if they don’t lead to something constructive in the first quarter of 2026, we plan to issue a summons that will set out our demands and calculations in detail,” she said.</p><p>“The European Court of Justice has determined that the rules are unfair. That is settled law. I hope FIFA accepts our offer to sit down at the table with experts and find a good way to resolve this.”</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>The Diarra ruling is the biggest challenge to the sport’s transfer market since the Bosman judgment in 1995, which abolished transfer fees for out-of-contract players and led to an explosion in wages, particularly at the top end of the pay scale.</p><p>The financial implications are huge. A study by <a href="https://www.compasslexecon.com/">economic consultancy firm Compass Lexecon</a>, commissioned by Justice for Players in the wake of the ruling, concluded that players had lost out on around 8% of their potential earnings on average as a result of FIFA’s restrictive transfer rules.</p><p>The total bill is likely to run into billions. “It’s a huge sum, but on the other hand, the damage has been inflicted across the 27 EU member states for years,” Melcherts said.</p><p>“Footballers are employees and employees have freedom of movement. But in this case the transfer fees, the compensation [for breach of contract] and the percentages that are demanded are extremely high, which goes against the principle that if an employee wants to change jobs, they should be free to do so.”</p><p>Premier league</p><p>The case also affects the English Premier League, Europe’s richest football competition, since Britain was a member of the European Union until the end of 2020.</p><p>Diarra, who also played for Chelsea, Arsenal and Real Madrid, and won 34 caps for France, is claiming €65 million from the Belgian FA and FIFA in a separate action for loss of earnings throughout his career from 2004 to 2019, which included spells with Chelsea, Arsenal, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain.</p><p>The French international took the Belgian football association URBSFA and FIFA to court in 2015 when Charleroi withdrew their offer of a contract under pressure from Lokomotiv Moscow, who threatened to sue under FIFA’s anti-poaching rules.</p><p>Diarra never played for Charleroi as a result. Instead, FIFA ordered the player to pay the Russian club €10.5 million in damages for breach of contract and suspended him from professional football for 15 months, a decision that was upheld by the Court for Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne.</p><h2>Not just superstars</h2><p>But Melcherts stressed that it is not only the superstars who have been affected. While top players such as Kylian Mbappé and Erling Haaland command annual salaries of more than €30 million, a 2016 global study on behalf of international players’ union FIFPro found that 45% of male footballers earned less than €11,000 a year.</p><p>“We have a whole bunch of footballers in the same situation as Diarra, which is why we’ve started a mass claim on their behalf, asking FIFA to change the rules and pay compensation,” she explained.</p><p>Sports lawyers have said that the upheaval could be exploited by players and their agents during contract negotiations.</p><p>Simon Leaf, a partner at London firm Mischcon de Reya, <a href="https://www.cityam.com/fifa-embarrassed-more-player-power-forced-transfers-legal-verdicts-on-the-diarra-ruling/">told City AM</a> it was “likely to lead to more disputes between clubs and players arising, as players may be emboldened when it comes to trying to force a transfer to take place.”</p><h2>Clearer contract</h2><p>But Melcherts argued that clearer contract terms would reduce the risk of escalating disputes such as <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/uk/football/liverpool/news/mohamed-salah-leaving-liverpool-transfer-latest/3ce18ce8ba271fbdba9e354d">the row between Liverpool and their Egyptian striker Mo Salah</a>. Salah was dropped from the squad after giving an interview in which he claimed his relationship with Dutch coach Arne Slot was “broken”.</p><p>Salah agreed a new contract with Liverpool in April including an annual salary of around €30 million, but there is speculation the player’s disruptive behaviour may be an attempt to engineer a move to Saudi Arabia, where his potential earnings are several times higher.</p><p>“At the moment the amount a player has to play in compensation is highly complex and varies from player to player,” Melcherts said. “That makes It even more important to have clarity so that players know from the outset what’s going to happen and where they stand, because at the moment it’s so unpredictable.”</p><h2>Rule changes</h2><p>FIFA has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/fifa-amends-transfer-regulations-following-diarra-ruling-2024-12-23/">made some changes to its transfer rules</a> since the Diarra ruling, introducing the concept of a “just cause” setting out the grounds on which players can leave their clubs before the end of the contract if there is a dispute.</p><p>But the players’ union FIFPro has criticised the new rules as too restrictive and says they have been imposed without a proper consultative process.</p><p>“It’s a small change, but we’re not satisfied with it,” Melcherts said. “We need to come up with a system of rules that is generated by all parties working together, not imposed by one side.”</p><p>Justice for Players has set up an anonymous registration mechanism for current and former players to join the class action. So far a few hundred have signed up, but Melcherts says others may have concerns about the impact on their careers.</p><p>“Players don’t have to worry that FIFA will blacklist them somehow,” she said. “It’s totally anonymous. We need to show to the court that there is a real problem that affects footballers, and that we are representative and competent to bring the case.</p><p>“In principle it applies to all footballers: those who earn a lot and those who don’t earn as much. That’s why we’re determined to make sure the transfer rules are fair and just for everyone and they get fair and just compensation for the damage they have suffered.”</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/court-cases/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/football/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/jobs/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=261429</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 18:18:58 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Gordon Darroch]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Wolf with tracker swims over rivers, travels 30 kilometres a day</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/01/wolf-with-tracker-swims-over-rivers-travels-30-kilometres-a-day/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-261987 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-research category-society category-wolf newsletter-include"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Wolf with tracker swims over rivers, travels 30 kilometres a day</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-01-08T14:32:36+00:00"> January 8, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261988" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_261988"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="1596" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-08-at-15.20.50-scaled.png" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-08-at-15.20.50-scaled.png 2560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-08-at-15.20.50-560x349.png 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-08-at-15.20.50-1200x748.png 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-08-at-15.20.50-768x479.png 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-08-at-15.20.50-1536x958.png 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-08-at-15.20.50-2048x1277.png 2048w" width="2560"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-261988"> A wildlife camera captures wolves in motion.

More than 400 visitors have also voluntarily carried GPS trackers while walking in the park, covering almost 13,000 kilometres in total.</p><p data-end="860" data-start="562">Early results from the wolf’s transmitter show how freely the animal moves across the Netherlands. Since being tagged on 16 October 2025, the wolf has travelled 2,528.5 kilometres, crossing four provinces and passing through the territories of nine different packs.</p><p data-end="860" data-start="562"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1147" data-start="862">Data show the wolf ranged through Gelderland, Overijssel, Drenthe and Utrecht, covering an average of around 30 kilometres a day. Shortly after being collared in the Hoge Veluwe, it left the park and spent two weeks moving through Overijssel and Drenthe before returning to the Veluwe.</p><p data-end="1440" data-start="1149">From late October until early December the animal stayed mainly in the south-east Veluwe. On 6 December it moved on to the Utrechtse Heuvelrug, where it has been detected regularly for about a month.</p><p data-end="1440" data-start="1149">It is to early to say if the wolf is considering making that region its home,  the researchers say.</p><p data-end="1440" data-start="1149"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1440" data-start="1149">“The wolf with the tracker illustrates how well wolves can move through the landscape,” researcher Frank van Langevelde said. “It swam across the IJssel river and back, and it crossed several motorways, always at night.”</p><p data-end="2990" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="" data-start="2735">The study aims to provide a factual basis for debate and policy on wolves by measuring how they, their prey and people use the landscape. For now, researchers say, the available data are still too limited to draw firm conclusions.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/research/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/society/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/wolf/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=261987</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 14:32:36 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item></channel></rss>
