with the primary aim of ending drugs tourism from neighbouring Belgium, France and Germany.</p><p data-end="683" data-start="387">But an exception was made for Amsterdam, on the condition that the city withdrew licences from coffeeshops located too close to schools. Now, however, there is likely to be a majority in favour of keeping tourists out of the city’s cafes as well, as part of the drive to <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/09/amsterdammers-take-city-council-to-court-to-tackle-over-tourism/">reduce nuisance tourism</a>.</p><p data-end="683" data-start="387"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="838" data-start="685">Mayor Femke Halsema is known to favour a ban and last year the <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/10/amsterdams-pvda-branch-wants-to-ban-tourists-from-coffeeshops/">PvdA said it too</a> would back a ban in the city centre, where most coffeeshops are located. The Liberal democratic party D66 and the left-wing Greens GroenLinks, which are likely to be the biggest parties on the city council alongside the PvdA after the vote, are opposed.</p><p data-end="838" data-start="685">But several other parties support a ban, including the VVD and CDA.
