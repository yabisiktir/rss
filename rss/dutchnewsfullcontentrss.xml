rules aimed at ending sham self-employment, the expected mass exit of freelancers has not taken place, according to an <a href="https://www.volkskrant.nl/economie/stonden-zzp-ers-dit-jaar-in-de-rij-om-een-vast-contract-te-tekenen~be47e623/">analysis by the Volkskrant</a>.</p><p data-end="412" data-start="290">Despite warnings of “empty classrooms” and a “care infarction”, 94% of freelancers have continued working, the paper said.</p><p data-end="768" data-start="414">Nevertheless, figures from the national statistics office CBS show that for the first time in more than 10 years, the number of freelancers has fallen. In the third quarter, the CBS counted 73,000 fewer freelancers than a year earlier, marking what chief economist Piet Hein van Mulligen said was “a clear break” with the previous decade of rapid growth.</p><p data-end="936" data-start="770">The change follows years of policy aimed at stimulating entrepreneurship, including tax advantages that made freelance work attractive for both workers and employers.</p><p data-end="936" data-start="770"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1184" data-start="938">The sharpest reductions are in healthcare, where 20,000 freelancers stopped working independently, followed by smaller declines in education, industry and the financial sector. The number of freelancers in the cultural sector has remained stable.</p><p data-end="1424" data-start="1186">Those who left freelance work often shifted to payroll jobs, the Volkskrant said. On average, 30,000 former freelancers moved into employment each quarter this year. Smaller groups became agency or on-call workers, left the labour market or became unemployed.</p><p data-end="1660" data-start="1426">Around 1.2 million people in the Netherlands currently work as freelancers. The social affairs ministry said in July it estimates that around 200,000 of the Netherlands’ registered freelancers should be employed on standard contracts.</p><p data-end="1660" data-start="1426"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1895" data-start="1662">Work is underway on new legislation which will give more clarity about who is a freelancer and who is not. That draft bill includes a €36 per hour minimum wage, with the aim of weeding out delivery drivers and other low-paid workers.</p><p data-end="2119" data-start="1897">However, its future remains in doubt because of opposition in the lower house of parliament, and it will probably be up to the new government to draw up a new definition of what freelance work entails, the Volkskrant said.</p><p data-end="2351" data-start="2121">Meanwhile, legal experts warn that enforcement will tighten again next year, when the tax office will start issuing fines to companies employing freelancers who, under current definitions, should actually be on ordinary contracts.</p><p data-end="2689" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="" data-start="2353">The current rules, which actually came into force in 2016 but have been ignored until now, state that someone is presumed to be self-employed if they carry financial risks, have their own tools and other equipment, have specific expertise that the company renting them does not have and present themselves as a freelancer while working.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div

But Elon Musk changed the policy after acquiring the company, in 2022, issuing checkmarks to premium subscribers.</p><p>Another issue raised by the commission is the lack of “critical information” in the X ad repository, including the content and topic of the advertisement and the entity paying for it, which are required under EU rules to ensure transparency, especially in political campaigns.</p><p>The Commission also said x fails to provide access to the platform’s public data for researchers, “effectively undermining research into several systemic risks in the European Union.”</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>The fine is the first penalty imposed by the commission over breaches of the EU Digital Services Act (DSA). The regulation was adopted in 2022 to establish transparency obligations in order to address the spread of disinformation, illegal content and misleading practices on large online platforms.</p><p>It also sought to harmonise a growing body of different national laws in this area. The rules apply to social networks, online marketplaces, content sharing platforms, app stores, and online travel and accommodation platforms.</p><p>Tech, sovereignty, security and democracy commissioner Henna Virkkunen said on Friday that the DSA is restoring trust in the online environment. “With the DSA’s first non-compliance decision, we are holding X responsible for undermining users’ rights and evading accountability,” she said.</p><h2>Sixty days</h2><p>X now has now 60 working days to inform the commission of how it intends to comply with EU rules regarding the use of blue checkmarks, and 90 days regarding the advertising repository and researchers’ access to public data.</p><p>Failure to take action may lead to further penalties. Under the DSA fines can be up to 6% of a company’s global annual turnover.</p><p>The commission decision is further straining relationships with the US. In reaction to the announcement, US secretary of state Marco Rubio said on the social media channel that the “European Commission’s $140 million fine isn’t just an attack on X, it’s an attack on all American tech platforms and the American people by foreign governments. The days of censoring Americans online are over.”</p><h2>Wilders</h2><p>European far-right figures also criticised the commission decision. Dutch far right leader Geert Wilders posted on Saturday: “Nobody elected you. You represent no one. You are a totalitarian institution and can’t event spell the words freedom of speech. We should not accept the fining of X, but abolish the EU commission.”</p><p><a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/01/nearly-500000-people-quit-x-in-the-netherlands-last-year/">Last year</a>, some 500,000 people and several media organisations in the Netherlands left X over concerns about the spread of hate speech and disinformation.
