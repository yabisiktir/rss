It is part of a project to find out more about a talented artist who died of tuberculosis at just 28, and remind the public of what was once considered a national masterpiece.</p><p>The Bull was one of the paintings belonging to William V that were <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2023/09/french-still-have-70-paintings-looted-from-the-dutch-by-napoleon/">looted from the Netherlands</a> in the Napoleonic era, and taken to form part of the collection of what would become the Louvre. As the Netherlands became a vassal state of France and Willem fled to England in 1795, the French carefully labelled his 194 paintings and shipped them – without even rolling up The Bull – to Paris.</p><p>There, it was considered a star attraction. “They loved it,” said Schilder, “and the fact that it wasn’t allegorical. It means nothing more than a group of animals in a landscape. They copied it, they made prints of it, they adored it, but they also restored it.”</p><p><strong>Symbolic</strong></p><p>After armed Dutch troops turned up in 1815 – with stories of the French hiding the ladders of the Louvre in order to frustrate the Dutch attempt to reclaim this large painting – The Bull was brought back to the Netherlands in a triumphal procession.</p><p>Although it is now less well known than, for example, Vermeer’s Girl with a Pearl Earring, in the 19th century it came back in a triumphal procession. Its one human character, the farmer, even became one of the illustrations in a standard guide to teach all children in the Netherlands to read.</p><p>“It kind of became a symbol of the entire country, because it’s so relatable to the Dutch to have a cow and a bull,” said Vandivere. “It’s about reproduction, but also about agriculture, economics…even manure.”</p><p>After painstakingly removing the old, yellowing varnish and layers of overpainting from four previous restorations, the experts carefully decided which changes to cover up and which to repair.</p><p>A “French branch”, added in Paris, was overpainted, for example. While they were discovered during scanning, the original bull’s testicles remain hidden as Potter intended – apart from in a separate display to visitors.</p><p>A new exhibition is now planned for 2027 to reintroduce the Dutch public to Potter and The Bull. “We call it,” said Schilder, “our Moona Lisa.”</p><p><em>A <a href="https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/what-s-on/exhibitions/a-peek-at-potter">Peek at Potter</a> is currently on show at the Mauritshuis</em></p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/art-and-culture/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/museums/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/society/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=262206</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 09:43:26 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Senay Boztas]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Forecasters say chilly weather is set to return later this month</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/01/forecasters-say-chilly-weather-is-set-to-return-later-this-month/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-262248 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-snow category-society category-weather newsletter-include"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Forecasters say chilly weather is set to return later this month</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-01-15T09:42:16+00:00"> January 15, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-208196" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_208196"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="1200" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-1.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-1.jpg 1600w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-1-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-1-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-1-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-1-640x480.jpg 640w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-1-83x62.jpg 83w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-1-130x98.jpg 130w" width="1600"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-208196"> A frosty Vondelpark in Amsterdam.
