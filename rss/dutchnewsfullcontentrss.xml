The PVV is one of two parties, along with Forum voor Democratie, that D66 and CDA have ruled out including in a coalition.</p><p>Buma said the two leaders had made “tough choices”, but the real difficult choices will have to be made when other parties join them at the negotiating table.</p><p>The parties deliberately chose to leave out any details of how their plans would be funded, since money tends to be the main sticking point in forming coalitions. That allowed CDA and D66 to present a wish list that appeals to nearly all parties, but also forces all prospective partners to make concessions.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>The programme includes ideas for the next cabinet term, but also long-term ambitions for “tomorrow and the day after”, emphasising the parties’ determination not to get bogged down in short-term thinking.</p><p>They aim to achieve the target of building 100,000 homes a year, which the last two cabinets set but failed to realise, with 21 large newbuild projects and extending existing suburbs, but D66’s flagship policy of building 10 new cities is conspicuous by its absence.</p><p>Dilan Yesilgöz, leader of the right-wing liberal VVD, said she was willing to work on “concrete solutions for the problems of our time”. “We will examine this document to see if there are enough points on which we can hold further discussions,” she said.</p><p>CDA and D66 included a commitment to phase out mortgage interest tax relief, which the VVD said it would protect during the election campaign, but the two parties did not specify any timetable.</p><p>They also want to retain the so-called “spreading law” for asylum seekers, giving the government the power to force local councils to accommodate asylum seekers, which divided the VVD.</p><p>Yesilgöz and the parliamentary party broadly opposed it, even though it was originally drafted by the former VVD asylum minister Eric van der Burg and supported by the party’s Senate faction.</p><h2>Four parties</h2><p>Yesilgöz is also continuing to rule out joining a cabinet that includes the left-wing alliance of GroenLinks-PvdA, which is the only combination of four parties that would have a clear majority in parliament.</p><p>GL-PvdA leader Jesse Klaver also said he was willing to negotiate on D66 and CDA’s plans, even though they were “not green enough”. The two parties agreed to maintain the current target of bringing nitrogen compound emissions below legal limits by 2035, even though D66 and GL-PvdA want to move this deadline to 2030.</p><p>Jetten and Bontenbal have hinted they are willing to consider a minority cabinet, which would allow them to form a three-party coalition with the VVD or include another right-wing party such as JA21.</p><p>Both leaders criticised the previous cabinet, a four-way right-wing combination in which none of the party leaders held ministerial posts, as a failed experiment. But Buma also said there was an “urgent” need for new leadership, since Dick Schoof’s caretaker cabinet of VVD and BBB only has 26 seats.</p><p>“We’re used to majority cabinets in the Netherlands that are more stable in terms of seats, but nobody wants to see an endless formation process,” Jetten said.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/election-2025/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/politics/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=260665</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 09:50:09 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Gordon Darroch]]></dc:creator></item></channel></rss>
