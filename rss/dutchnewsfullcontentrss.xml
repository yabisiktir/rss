Here’s what you need to know about local government in the Netherlands and voting in the elections.</p><p><strong>Who can vote</strong></p><p>To vote in the national elections you must have Dutch nationality, but the situation is different in the local elections. These categories of residents can vote:</p><p>1. Dutch nationals</p><p>2. EU nationals</p><p>3. Foreign nationals who have lived officially in the Netherlands for more than five years</p><p>If you are eligible to vote, you will automatically receive a voting card posted by your local council. You need to take this card, and ID, to the polling station when you go to cast your vote.</p><p>Voting takes place in polling stations, usually located in schools, community centres and other public buildings. Some councils set up polling stations in railway stations to catch early morning commuters or other odd places, such as churches or even a windmill to encourage people to vote.</p><p>The polling stations are open from 7.30am to 9pm, when the count begins. Municipal elections are held every four years.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p><strong>How local government works</strong></p><p>The Netherlands is a parliamentary democracy with two chambers: the lower house of parliament or <em>Tweede Kamer der Staten-Generaal</em> with 150 seats, and the senate or <em>Eerste Kamer der Staten-Generaal</em> which has 75 seats.</p><p>All Dutch nationals aged 18 or over can vote for members of the Tweede Kamer – compulsory voting was abolished in 1970. The political make-up of the senate is based on the proportion of votes parties get in the elections for the 12 provincial councils, or <em>Provinciale Staten</em>.</p><p>The third tier in government is the 342 local councils, or <em>gemeentes</em>. They range in size from Amsterdam and Rotterdam to conglomerations of small villages. Amsterdam and Rotterdam also have a fourth layer, the district committees, which focus on very local issues.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/11/how-to-vote-in-next-years-local-elections-in-amsterdam/"><strong>More on the local elections in Amsterdam</strong></a></li></ul><p>The number of councillors in a <em>gemeenteraad</em> depends on the size of the local authority area. Councils with a population of more than 200,000 residents have 45 members and the smallest, with fewer than 3,000 residents, just nine.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>Local councils are run by the mayor (who is appointed by the crown) and a team of <em>wethouders</em>, or executives. The <em>college van burgemeester en wethouders</em> (B&amp;W) is the local authority equivalent of the national government’s cabinet.</p><p>As with national government, the Dutch electoral system makes coalition councils inevitable. As soon as the votes have been counted, work begins on putting together a working coalition. Once a coalition has been identified and agreed, the councillors appoint the executives who are, in effect, local government ministers. This process can take several weeks.</p><p><strong>What do local authorities do?</strong></p><p>Some 90% of local council funding in the Netherlands comes from national government. Councils themselves raise money through local property taxes, waste collection and water charges, parking fees, road taxes, tourist taxes and dog taxes.</p><p>The main tasks of local councils are:</p><p>1. Ensuring sufficient housing, planning future developments and drawing up zoning laws, together with housing corporations.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-255319" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_255319" style="width: 560px"><noscript><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-255319" decoding="async" height="420" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9278-560x420.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9278-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9278-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9278-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9278-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9278.jpg 1917w" width="560"/></noscript><img alt="" class="lazyload size-medium wp-image-255319" data-sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" data-src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9278-560x420.jpg" data-srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9278-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9278-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9278-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9278-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9278.jpg 1917w" decoding="async" height="420" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20560%20420%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="560"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-255319">A bulky waste collection point.

That means the real number of vacancies is much higher,” Nationale Vacaturebank director Sharita Boon said.</p><p>The site does not keep a record of how many of the vacancies are being filled, Boon said but more than one employer is looking for youngsters with an MBO trade school diploma in a tight labour market.</p><p>Candidates must also be willing to undergo military training. “Cooks and mechanics may be called on to fight if necessary. This has happened several times in Uruzgan,” the spokesman said.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex
