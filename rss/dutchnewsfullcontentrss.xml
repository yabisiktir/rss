At that point, they said, they had not yet received a formal letter from the court, but that the media were already reporting the ruling.</p><p data-end="842" data-start="547">The couple married on April 19 last year with a close friend acting as the registrar. They opted for a light-hearted ceremony, which they said succeeded in setting the right tone on the day.</p><p data-end="842" data-start="547"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1278" data-start="844">Under Dutch law, a marriage is only valid if both partners explicitly declare that they accept each other as spouses and will fulfill the legal duties attached to marriage.</p><p data-end="1278" data-start="844">In this case, the official asked the groom whether he wanted to stand by his partner “today, tomorrow and all the days to come”, and asked the bride whether she was “choosing him again today”. The ceremony ended without the formal legal wording required by law.</p><p data-end="1634" data-start="1280">According to the couple, someone in the audience raised concerns immediately after the ceremony and suggested repeating the vows later. However, the council official who attended the wedding decided intervention was unnecessary.</p><p data-end="1634" data-start="1280">Three months later, after the couple had returned from their honeymoon, the municipality informed them that the ceremony had not been legally valid.</p><p data-end="1634" data-start="1280"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1985" data-start="1636">The couple said one point in the court ruling was particularly painful. It stated that the officiant’s speech had been written with the help of ChatGPT.</p><p data-end="1985" data-start="1636">“That is not true,” they said. Their friend had only asked an AI tool to check whether his text met the legal requirements, they said, stressing they wanted to defend him against public criticism.</p><p data-end="2502" data-start="2209">The error came to light later when a civil registry official reviewed an audio recording of the ceremony and found the mandatory legal text was missing. The council was then required to inform the public prosecution service, which asked the court to strike the marriage from the register.</p><h2 data-end="2502" data-start="2209">Wedding date</h2><p data-end="2750" data-start="2504">The couple asked whether they could keep their original wedding date, which marked 10 years of their relationship, but the court rejected the request, saying it could not deviate from the law despite understanding the date’s personal importance.</p><p data-end="3071" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="" data-start="2752">They have since married again in a short ceremony at the town hall in July. That date is now their official wedding anniversary, though not the one they say they will remember. “It’s unfortunate it turned out this way,” they told RTL. “We’ve been dealing with it for almost a year. Hopefully, one day we’ll laugh about it.”</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/ai/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/court-cases/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/society/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=261972</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 13:31:59 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Noor and Noah top most popular names for babies in 2025</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/01/noor-and-noah-top-most-popular-names-for-babies-in-2025/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-261953 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-children category-society"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Noor and Noah top most popular names for babies in 2025</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-01-08T10:11:29+00:00"> January 8, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-208813" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_208813"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="750" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Depositphotos_71149505_S.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Depositphotos_71149505_S.jpg 1000w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Depositphotos_71149505_S-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Depositphotos_71149505_S-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Depositphotos_71149505_S-640x480.jpg 640w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Depositphotos_71149505_S-83x62.jpg 83w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Depositphotos_71149505_S-130x98.jpg 130w" width="1000"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-208813"> Blue for a boy.

These days you can find her giving lessons on the Amstel River at <a href="https://karzvdehoop.nl/">De Hoop boat club</a> in Amsterdam Oost, one of the country’s oldest.</p><p>“You’re with people week in and week out and build trust and connection so much faster,” says Lesh, who admits to speaking “rowing” Dutch. “You see the cultural similarities. Rowing is rowing. The words may be different, but the sport is the same.”</p><p>Lesh, who moved from Switzerland to Amsterdam in 2021, says rowing has helped her build a strong people network, make business connections and even integrate into Dutch society, including learning how to navigate the Dutch healthcare system.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>“The sports element is common, but sitting with a coffee later is a way to make deeper connections,” she says. “You get access to knowledge with people who want to help you because you’re part of a team.”</p><p>She notes that in Switzerland and the Netherlands, adults are encouraged to join sports clubs, as compared to the US, where you have to seek them out. “It’s normal here, it’s more social,” she says. “You’re kind of expected to stay for a coffee. It’s a more holistic experience.”</p><p>One of her first-time rowing students, Brazilian Jefferson Gomes (33), agrees. “I decided to join the rowing club because I wanted to pick up a sport and feel more integrated into the community. It turned out to be a great decision — I’ve learned a few Dutch words (even if they’re mostly rowing-related!) and met some really nice people.”</p><p>He especially enjoys summer rowing on the Amstel, the many club-organised events and the opportunity to volunteer at races and competitions, “which makes the whole experience even more enjoyable.”</p><h2><strong>Volunteering</strong></h2><p>Volunteering is a big part of sports club life in the Netherlands, especially for smaller organisations that have fewer members and resources than some of the bigger field hockey and football clubs.</p><p>It’s something that parents quickly discover when they sign up their offspring for one of the many Amsterdam hockey or football clubs. Bar shifts and driving to away games are very much part of the job.</p><p>Unlike in many countries, competitive sports for children are arranged around clubs not schools, and they are a place where youngsters often make friends for life.</p><p>Dutch brand and design consultant Theo Lindemann (62) is a cricket player and board member at <a href="https://www.vra.nl/en">VRA Cricket Amsterdam</a>, the country’s largest cricket club. A teenage baseball player, he became fascinated by cricket, but there was none of it in the east of the country when he was growing up. A Dutch friend brought him into VRA 35 years ago, and he hasn’t looked back.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261263" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_261263" style="width: 560px"><noscript><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-261263" decoding="async" height="374" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-560x374.jpeg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-560x374.jpeg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-1200x800.jpeg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-360x240.jpeg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-768x512.jpeg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w" width="560"/></noscript><img alt="" class="lazyload size-medium wp-image-261263" data-sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" data-src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-560x374.jpeg" data-srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-560x374.jpeg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-1200x800.jpeg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-360x240.jpeg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-768x512.jpeg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w" decoding="async" height="374" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20560%20374%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="560"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-261263">VRA Cricket Amsterdam.

They’ve travelled the world together playing cricket – from Cape Town to Goa to Philadelphia – while here in Amsterdam, they make sure the substantial number of transient international club members feel at home.</p><p>But with only some 450 club members, as compared to 2,500 for a big field hockey organisation, everyone is expected to do their part. And at VRA Amsterdam, a large part of that centres around the clubhouse, which serves as a socialising spot to meet people outside of work and family.</p><p>“The bigger clubs can afford to hire a professional hospitality worker, but the small clubs can’t do that,” he says. Everyone pitches in behind the bar and also helps prepare the grass pitches and take care of the practice nets.</p><p>“The city helps with the maintenance of the fields,” he says, “but we own the pavilion and must maintain it. It’s all volunteers.” After they bought the clubhouse in 2019, a lot of people who couldn’t get to the office because of COVID had time on their hands to help renovate the building at a time when construction work was still allowed. “We needed all the volunteers we could get,” he says. “And we got them.”</p><h2>Beer and <em>bitterballen</em></h2><p>Fellow cricket VRA club member Prasun Bannerjee (45) moved to Amsterdam from Calcutta in 2017 as a highly skilled migrant. He’s one of the club members—some 50% of them—who hail from India or Pakistan.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>“In India, cricket is a religion,” says the systems engineer who dreamed of pursuing cricket as a career when he was young. He applauds the cricket infrastructure in the Netherlands, which helped him meet people and integrate while playing a sport he loved.</p><p>“The social part is very interesting to me,” he says. “A game, some beer, a few <em>bitterballen</em> and a chat. In India, that’s only at the experienced level.”</p><p>While Bannerjee plays competitive cricket, which is all about the sport, he also enjoys the social league, where people come to enjoy the game and camaraderie but don’t get competitively crazy.</p><p>“You get to meet locals and others in the cricket diaspora, which is a mix of ages, skill levels and demographics,” he says. “Especially in the summer, when there are barbeques and dinners and drinks. That’s how friendships develop.”</p><p>Now that it’s winter, club members still train together, play padel and often meet for dinner and game nights at someone’s home. He urges newcomers to join social cricket, which he says is unique to the Netherlands.</p><p>“Our cricket team plays poker during the winter,” he says. “I’m now getting hooked on poker!”</p><h2>Don’t give up!</h2><p>But sometimes finding a sports club can be difficult, says Cathy Leung (52), executive producer of Bram Radio and the Broadcast Amsterdam foundation. The London native moved to Amsterdam 15 years ago with her Dutch husband. She actually met him on a hockey pitch while playing on a corporate club in Britain. Once they moved to the Netherlands, finding a proper hockey club was her priority.</p><p>“I found it difficult to locate one,” she says, “which is surprising because there are so many clubs here. But a lot of people play. It’s a bit who you know here.”</p><p>Leung says not speaking Dutch also hampered her. She bounced around a few hockey clubs trying to find a good fit, and enjoyed playing on Ernst &amp; Young’s corporate club, but, after the birth of her daughter, she traded in her hockey stick for a tennis racquet.</p><p>At the <a href="https://www.tennisclubkattenlaan.nl/">T.C. Kattenlaan</a> tennis club in the Vondelpark, Leung started organising teams and became a captain. She eventually joined the club’s policy-setting committee, which meant her Dutch was up to par.</p><h2>Stand up for yourself</h2><p>“I was forced to speak Dutch, which is right,” she says. “It’s very integrating, learning the rules and settling arguments in Dutch. I’ve made connections and learned how to stand up for myself and not be a passive player.”</p><p>Her advice to those who are club searching in the city? “Don’t give up! There are lots of different clubs,” she says. “Finding and getting onto the right team is challenging. But get a taste of different clubs to get an idea of their culture.”</p><p>For tennis, you can do that via a membership of the <a href="https://www.knltb.nl/">KNLTB</a> tennis association, the umbrella organization for tennis, padel and pickleball in the Netherlands.</p><p>Leung herself has actually found her way back to hockey via tennis through a teammate who invited her to her club. “Sometimes it’s knowing people who open doors,” says Leung. “I went on a ski vacation with my new hockey team. Between tennis and hockey, I have two very strong social networks.”</p><p><em>From baseball to ice hockey, lacrosse to rugby, padel to badminton. Amsterdam has hundreds of team sports clubs.

Parents also want to be informed in time. On Tuesday, some pupils had already set out when the message came that it would not open.</p><p>Schools do have a duty to accommodate children whose parents cannot arrange for a babysitter, particularly for children in primary schools. Child care organisations, which include BSO after-school care, are usually asked to jump in.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>As far as work goes, working from home would seem to be the practical solution.

Employees have a duty to turn up at work, even if there is no public transport, he said.</p><p>It is up to them to sort out alternative transport, but in practice, employers are willing to cooperate. “It is important to find a solution together,” Berghuis said. “Car pooling, or adapting the work schedule, can work, or switching days off,” he said.</p><p>If the presence of a worker is absolutely necessary, employers can arrange transport and pay for the extra cost that may entail.</p><h2>Delivery workers</h2><p>However, if the government’s highway agency says not to travel at all, as was the case in Utrecht on Monday, employers will often tell workers to stay put and that the company will close that day.</p><p>Builders, postmen and women and care workers are facing the biggest challenges, Berghuis said. An “unworkable weather” clause is in place for people with outdoor professions, meaning the worker can stay at home without having to sacrifice days off. The exact circumstances are included in the CAO, or collective work agreement.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/society/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/weather/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=261913</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 15:11:43 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Hanneke Sanou]]></dc:creator></item></channel></rss>
