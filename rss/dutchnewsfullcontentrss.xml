JD Vance said the US had been borrowing money from Chinese peasants and Trump said China needed the US to survive.</p><p>I fondly remember Victor Gao’s remarks, “China has been here for 5,000 years. Most of the time, there was no United States and we survived. And if the United States wants to bully China, we will deal with the situation without the United States, and we expect to survive for another 5,000 years.”</p><p>Since then, we’ve seen a pattern emerge from the US. Trump will declare sweeping destructive tariffs that threaten US and foreign economic prospects. He is holding a box of matches in a room filled with petrol and telling everyone that if he needs to win or everyone is getting burned.</p><h2>Winning headlines</h2><p>I believe he thinks such displays show he’s a strong decisive leader. However, he’s always shown to be weak when he reneges on these decisions when the smallest crumb of his demands are met.</p><p>In short, all Trump is looking for is to have headlines tell everyone he’s winning. Most foreign leaders have more nuanced goals, which often involve improving the long term economic prospects for their countries.</p><p>This fundamental disconnect is why the Busan meeting was never a negotiating session, but a masterclass in political stagecraft. Trump’s effusive praise—calling the meeting “amazing” and rating it “12 on a 10-point scale”—was the precise, headline-ready product he wanted.</p><p>The agreement itself was an elegantly simple transaction: China traded two low-cost concessions for a high-value reduction in US tariffs. Both parties got a “win,” but only one of them secured a substantive, long-term economic gain.</p><h2>What did China give up?</h2><p>Let’s be clear about what China gave up. They agreed to resume soybean purchases. This is an obvious, easy-to-reverse commercial decision that placates the critical American farm belt and provides a neat, tangible figure for a US press release.</p><p>China had already successfully diversified its supply chains and this simply gives American farmers temporary relief and an optimistic headline, while not structurally binding Beijing.</p><p>They also agreed to a one-year suspension of recently threatened rare earths export curbs. This is a strategic pause, not a surrender of their biggest geopolitical weapon. They didn’t dismantle their decades-long control over the world’s most critical minerals; they simply postponed deploying their latest threat, retaining their chokehold on the supply chain while looking magnanimous.</p><p>These concessions are political gestures, flexible to China’s needs, and do not require Xi Jinping to alter a single line of state industrial policy or give up a single inch of industrial strategy.</p><h2>Tariff reduction</h2><p>What did they get in return for these symbolic moves? A crucial 10% reduction in US tariffs, bringing the combined rate on Chinese goods down from 57% to 47%. This is the prize. That reduction offers immediate, quantifiable economic relief to countless Chinese manufacturers struggling under the punitive costs of the trade war. It provides essential breathing room and stabilizes the external pressure on their economy.</p><p>This is a deal that shows China has learned how to play Trump’s game, and they are playing it better.

href="https://www.amsterdamfoodie.nl/wine-consultancy/"><strong>Vicky Hampton</strong></a><strong>, shares her seasonal wine picks for those on a budget and those with a little more cash to splash. </strong></p><p><strong>As more and more of us celebrate Thanksgiving here in the Netherlands, this month’s column covers the perfect wines to accompany a Thanksgiving feast! (Plus, with turkey featuring on many a Christmas table too, the same principles apply…)</strong></p><p>My first experience of Thanksgiving was in 2012, and I threw myself straight in at the deep end. My then-boyfriend had moved over to Amsterdam from Louisiana six months prior, and I was determined to make him feel at home for his first Thanksgiving away from the US.</p><p>I raced around ordering a turkey from the butcher, frantically googling suitable side dishes and wondering whether we were supposed to exchange gifts. I discovered bizarre traditions aplenty, some of which I adopted (an American casserole is nothing like a European casserole, but it can be perfectly delightful), and some of which I didn’t (any potato dish involving a topping of marshmallows is just plain wrong).</p><p>Thirteen years later, my familiarity with Thanksgiving has increased – not least because I’ve been invited by my in-laws to celebrate it in the States several times since. But my trepidation about the sheer amount of food that needs to be put on the table still runs high.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>From a wine perspective, it’s a bit of a minefield. You’ve got the turkey itself, which is pretty wine-friendly with its neutral poultry flavour and proteins that’ll bind to the wine’s tannins. But cover it in gravy and cranberry sauce and you suddenly have intense savouriness and sweetness to contend with in the same mouthful.</p><p>Speaking of sweetness, sweet potatoes are always a popular addition to the Thanksgiving table, but the myriad vegetable-based “casseroles” are often cheesy and/or creamy – two flavour profiles that would normally require radically different wine pairings.</p><p>Then of course there’s my favourite element: the stuffing, which can veer meaty or fruity or earthy depending on the whims of the cook. And that’s before you’ve even got onto dessert.</p><p>As if all those flavours weren’t enough to contend with, there’s often the uncertainty of not knowing what other people are likely to make. Many a Thanksgiving dinner consists of a “potluck” approach in which everyone brings a side, while the host takes care of the turkey. Did I mention it’s a minefield?</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p><strong>How to choose wine for a Thanksgiving feast</strong></p><p>With all of this in mind, there’s an argument to be made for just picking up a few of your favourite bottles and not taking the whole pairing process too seriously. But that’s not why I write this wine column, so I’m attempting to give you a few basic guidelines…</p><p>White wines work best if they’re on the fuller-bodied side (think lightly oaked Chardonnay rather than spritzy Pinot Grigio), with plenty of acidity to cut through the richness of the food, plus a touch of residual sugar to prevent the sweet potatoes and cranberry sauce from making the wine taste like you’re sucking on a lemon.</p><p>A German Riesling could work if it carries the right balance of acidity, sweetness and body (ask your local wine shopkeeper to help you here, because there are a gazillion different styles of Riesling out there).</p><p>Conversely, light red wines tend to work better than heavier, oaked reds. Pinot Noir from Germany, Oregon or New Zealand would make a classic choice, or perhaps even a young Beaujolais (the Beaujolais Nouveau wines come out on the third Thursday of every November, which generally coincides with Thanksgiving).</p><p>If you want to go a little heavier, a crunchy Cabernet Franc from the Loire Valley could work well, as would a rustic red-fruited Sangiovese from Tuscany. At the end of the day, it comes down to personal preference.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-259022" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_259022" style="width: 560px"><noscript><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-259022" decoding="async" height="376" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Thanksgiving-wine-line-up_Photo-Vicky-Hampton-560x376.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Thanksgiving-wine-line-up_Photo-Vicky-Hampton-560x376.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Thanksgiving-wine-line-up_Photo-Vicky-Hampton-1200x806.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Thanksgiving-wine-line-up_Photo-Vicky-Hampton-768x516.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Thanksgiving-wine-line-up_Photo-Vicky-Hampton-1536x1032.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Thanksgiving-wine-line-up_Photo-Vicky-Hampton-2048x1376.jpg 2048w" width="560"/></noscript><img alt="" class="lazyload size-medium wp-image-259022" data-sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" data-src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Thanksgiving-wine-line-up_Photo-Vicky-Hampton-560x376.jpg" data-srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Thanksgiving-wine-line-up_Photo-Vicky-Hampton-560x376.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Thanksgiving-wine-line-up_Photo-Vicky-Hampton-1200x806.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Thanksgiving-wine-line-up_Photo-Vicky-Hampton-768x516.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Thanksgiving-wine-line-up_Photo-Vicky-Hampton-1536x1032.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Thanksgiving-wine-line-up_Photo-Vicky-Hampton-2048x1376.jpg 2048w" decoding="async" height="376" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20560%20376%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="560"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-259022">Photo: Vicky Hampton</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Best budget bottles: Well of Wine Pinot Noir 2023 and Camponovo Tenuta di Sesta 2023 (both €9.95)</strong></p><p>Why choose when you can buy both? Among my tasting panel, half of us preferred the juicy, bright red fruits of <a href="https://wellofwine.nl/products/well-of-wine-merlot-2020-copy">Well of Wine’s signature Pinot Noir</a> from the South of France (which was surprisingly fresh and lively for such a warm region). While the other half preferred the peppery cranberry and sour cherry of the <a href="https://www.bosmanwijnkopers.nl/nl/camponovo-rosso-toscane-2023.html">Toscana Rosso by Tenuta di Sesta</a> – a Tuscan red made predominantly from Sangiovese in Montalcino (budget Brunello, if you will).</p><p>And given that both reds are the same price, supplied by the same shop – <a href="https://www.bosmanwijnkopers.nl/">Bosman Wijnkopers in The Hague and online</a> – you might as well try both and decide for yourself. If ever there were an excuse for multiple bottles of wine, surely Thanksgiving is it!</p><p><strong>Magnificent mid-range: Li Camennere Malvasia Secca, Salento IGP 2023 (€13 as part of a case of six)</strong></p><p>Salento is in Puglia – the heel of Italy’s boot – and you can taste the sunshine in this full-bodied dry white made from aromatic Malvasia grapes. Think lots of yellow fruits (apricot, peach, pineapple), plus nutty, salted caramel and a touch of balsamic wood. The body of the wine stands up well to everything going on at a Thanksgiving dinner and, while the aromas can get a little lost among certain dishes, they shine with others.</p><p>This <a href="https://www.on-wine.com/en/salento-igp-malvasia-secca.html">Li Camennere Malvasia is available via On-Wine</a>, an online wine platform that connects consumers with producers – cutting out a few of the middlemen (exporters, importers and wine retailers). That means great value for the customer and better, fairer prices for the winemaker. A minimum order of six bottles per producer applies, but there’s plenty of choice (you can mix &amp; match among a winery’s range) and the price-quality ratio is unbeatable.</p><p><strong>Something special: Samson Straw Wine, Piekenierskloof 2020 (€23.50 per half bottle)</strong></p><p>Any Thanksgiving feast worth its salt involves dessert – traditionally pumpkin pie or pecan pie. Their flavours are variously sweet, spicy and nutty, and that’s what I’m looking for in a dessert wine as well. Piekenierskloof’s old-vine “straw wine” is so-called because bunches of grapes are laid out on straw to dry, lending them the sweetness of sultanas.</p><p>Available from <a href="https://www.africanwines.nl/wijnen/dessert/samson-straw-wine-375-ml-2020/">African Wines in the Hague</a>, this South African dessert wine has floral aromas of honeysuckle, warmly spiced flavours of cinnamon and bay leaf, and a refreshing lemon-curd acidity. Sweet but not cloying, it’s a luxurious end to a decadent meal.</p><p><em>For more of Vicky’s wine recommendations and grape explorations, follow </em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/trufflesandtannins/"><em>@TrufflesandTannins</em></a><em> on Instagram or subscribe to </em><a href="https://trufflesandtannins.substack.com/"><em>The Wine Edit on Substack</em></a><em>!</em></p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" href="/life-in-the-netherlands/food-drink/"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/wine/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=259021</guid><pubDate>Sat, 01 Nov 2025 07:54:08 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Film, theatre and stolen art:13 great things to do in November</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/10/film-theatre-and-stolen-art13-great-things-to-do-in-november/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-258575 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-art-and-culture newsletter-include"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Film, theatre and stolen art:13 great things to do in November</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2025-10-31T14:53:27+00:00"> October 31, 2025 </time> <a class="me-2" href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/author/hanneke/" rel="author"> Hanneke Sanou </a></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-259422" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_259422"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="643" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ANP-512500075.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ANP-512500075.jpg 1000w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ANP-512500075-560x360.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ANP-512500075-768x494.jpg 768w" width="1000"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-259422"> There is something for everyone during Museum Night.

Jetten just about edges out Wilders, Yesilgöz snatches defeat from the jaws of catastrophe, Bontenbal and Eerdmans console themselves with huge gains and Van Hijum starts browsing brochures for Sint Eustatius. Eight so-called sovereign citizens are charged with forming a senior citizens’ terror cell. Amsterdam sells itself short with its 750th birthday cake.

But the eventual beneficiary is not a charity foundation – it is the public limited company Concertgebouw NV, which was established in 1882.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>Director Simon Reinink confirmed to<a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2588629-fiscus-grijpt-in-bij-concertgebouw-om-belastingvoordelen"> public broadcaster NOS</a> that “the structure did not comply with the letter of the law”, though he said there had been no deliberate wrongdoing.</p><p data-end="897" data-start="682">The arrangement, which has existed since 2001 must be completely restructured by January 1, 2026 to retain its tax benefits, the tax office said. “And we will do that,” Reinink said. According to the FD Concertgebouw NV will also be turned into a foundation.</p><p data-end="907" data-start="899">The Concertgebouw, which has been privately funded for nearly 150 years, is one of the country’s most successful fundraising institutions. It has raised around €100 million over the past 25 years, much of which has gone on maintaining the historic building.</p><p data-end="907" data-start="899"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1737" data-start="1279">As yet it is unclear whether the Concertgebouw will now have to repay tens of millions of euros in back taxes. “We have no indication from the tax authorities that this will happen,” Reinink said.</p><p data-end="2723" data-start="2279">The governing bodies of both entities include several high-profile Dutch business leaders. Former Ahold CEO Dick Boer has chaired the Concertgebouw NV since 2017, while ex-Shell chief Jeroen van der Veer stepped down this month as chairman of the support foundation after his second term ended.</p><p data-end="3022" data-start="2725">Asked by the FD how such breaches could have occurred under such experienced leadership, Reinink said: “Interesting question. But none of us ever asked whether it was legally correct. The NV is part of our DNA. We raise money for a good cause — nothing more, nothing less. Nobody here has gained from it.”</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/amsterdam/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/charity/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/music-industry/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/tax/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=259411</guid><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 12:31:43 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item></channel></rss>
