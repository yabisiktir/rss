Luckily, that’s enough of a connection for us to review it. </strong></p><p dir="ltr">The novel opens with the adult Theo Decker, hiding, alone in a hotel room in Amsterdam. The events leading to his arrival in the Dutch capital date to a decade earlier. En route to a school meeting with his mother, which then 13-year-old Theo believes will result in his suspension, the pair visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art to view his mother’s favorite painting, the Dutch Golden Age masterpiece The Goldfinch (Het Puttertje).</p><p dir="ltr">While in the museum, Theo spots a beautiful redhead girl with whom he becomes instantly enamored. As they are leaving, his mother spontaneously decides to return to see The Goldfinch again and Theo heads off, ostensibly to the giftshop, but really to follow his new found love interest.</p><p dir="ltr">That decision will prove fateful. A bomb goes off in the gallery, killing a number of visitors, including his mother. Theo survives, and in the aftermath, grabs The Goldfinch from the floor. The rest of the novel will revolve around him keeping his theft a secret, and keeping the priceless artwork safe.</p><p dir="ltr"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p dir="ltr">One of Tartt’s many strengths as an author is her ability to write a coming of age story that feels like an adult novel. Theo spends the book feeling the vivid and valid emotions of a teenager and young adult, but the work isn’t melodramatic or frustrating.</p><p dir="ltr">Part of the reason the work doesn’t feel childish is that much of it is told by the adult Theo reflecting back on his life. The reader discovers that Theo may not be a wholly reliable narrator. He doesn’t seem to be intentionally lying to us, rather Tartt sets the reader and Theo up. Through Theo we see one version of events, but through the people around him, we see another side.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike many novels set in the Netherlands by non-Dutch authors, Tartt gets the Dutch stuff right. Amsterdam feels like Amsterdam, not a stereotyped veneer of Amsterdam. She does take liberty with the set up, though. The Goldfinch has never hung at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, its home is in the Mauritshuis in The Hague.</p><p dir="ltr"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p dir="ltr">Coincidentally, when The Goldfinch was published, the Mauritshuis was undergoing a major, two-year renovation. Many of its famous works were part of a traveling exhibition, Vermeer, Rembrandt, and Hals: Masterpieces of Dutch Painting.</p><p dir="ltr">The Goldfinch (the book) and The Goldfinch (the painting) debuted on the same day. At every other stop of the tour, Johannes Vermeer’s Girl with a Pearl Earring was top billing. But the October 22nd opening at New York’s Frick Collection welcomed Tartt fans – it was the author’s first book in a decade – in droves.</p><p dir="ltr">“With The Goldfinch’s help, the exhibition has become the best attended in Frick history.” the museum said in a press release at the time. Neither the museum or the publisher were aware the other’s avian event was taking place.</p><p dir="ltr">Tartt’s first book, The Secret History, was a run away best seller. The Goldfinch won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and was turned into a film starring Ansel Elgort.</p><p dir="ltr">At 771 pages, the Goldfinch is a hefty carry but you will be lugging it around. It’s addictive, brilliantly written and worth every word.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>You can get your copy at the <a href="https://abc.nl/book-details/the-goldfinch/@9780349139630">American Book Center</a>.</em></p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" href="/life-in-the-netherlands/books/"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/books/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=260018</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 08:15:04 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Molly Quell]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>New international student numbers fall for third year in a row</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/02/new-international-student-numbers-fall-for-third-year-in-a-row/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-263390 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-education category-hbo-colleges category-international-students category-students category-universities"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> New international student numbers fall for third year in a row</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-02-10T08:13:22+00:00"> February 10, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-184938" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_184938"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="480" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_7864.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_7864.jpg 640w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_7864-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_7864-83x62.jpg 83w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_7864-130x98.jpg 130w" width="640"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-184938"> Photo: DutchNews.nl</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><div class="relative basis-auto flex-col -mb-(--composer-overlap-px) [--composer-overlap-px:28px] grow flex"><div class="flex flex-col text-sm"><article class="text-token-text-primary w-full focus:outline-none [--shadow-height:45px] has-data-writing-block:pointer-events-none has-data-writing-block:-mt-(--shadow-height) has-data-writing-block:pt-(--shadow-height) [&amp;:has([data-writing-block])&gt;*]:pointer-events-auto scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]" data-scroll-anchor="true" data-testid="conversation-turn-26" data-turn="assistant" data-turn-id="47a65725-7d9f-4331-85cf-35f76fe715e8" dir="auto" tabindex="-1"><div class="text-base my-auto mx-auto pb-10 [--thread-content-margin:--spacing(4)] @w-sm/main:[--thread-content-margin:--spacing(6)] @w-lg/main:[--thread-content-margin:--spacing(16)] px-(--thread-content-margin)"><div class="[--thread-content-max-width:40rem] @w-lg/main:[--thread-content-max-width:48rem] mx-auto max-w-(--thread-content-max-width) flex-1 group/turn-messages focus-visible:outline-hidden relative flex w-full min-w-0 flex-col agent-turn" tabindex="-1"><div class="flex max-w-full flex-col grow"><div class="min-h-8 text-message relative flex w-full flex-col items-end gap-2 text-start break-words whitespace-normal [.text-message+&amp;]:mt-1" data-message-author-role="assistant" data-message-id="9d36ab57-fbbe-4947-8c1b-f33bb803161d" data-message-model-slug="gpt-5-2" dir="auto"><div class="flex w-full flex-col gap-1 empty:hidden first:pt-[1px]"><div class="markdown prose dark:prose-invert w-full wrap-break-word light markdown-new-styling"><p data-end="187" data-start="0">The number of first years starting a bachelor’s degree course at a Dutch university or HBO college has fallen again, with the biggest drop reported among students from other EU countries.</p><p data-end="427" data-start="189">In total, the number of students starting a university degree was down by 3% in the current academic year, with a 3.6% fall in the number of foreign students, according to university figures.
