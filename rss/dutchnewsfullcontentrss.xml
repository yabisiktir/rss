support the unions’ claims. They show that the number of people in their sixties claiming WIA has increased by 8% in the last 15 years, coinciding with a rise in the statutory retirement age from 65 to 67.</p><p>The previous government introduced rules allowing people in demanding manual roles to qualify for their pension at 64.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div

not to freeze this ruling, meaning these workers face having to work until the age of 67 by 2060.</p><p>Daniël van Vuuren, professor of labour economics at Tilburg University, said the waiting list for WIA applications was set to grow from 100,000 to 200,000 in the next three years and warned the problem will get worse once the new rules take effect in 2033.</p><p>He called on the government to move towards a system that gives workers more flexibility in deciding when they retire. “It is unfair to have everyone claiming their pension at the same age,” Van Vuuren said.</p></main><div

council agenda after the March 18 local elections.</p><p data-end="385" data-start="162">Since 2012, non-locals have been excluded from the cafes, known as coffeeshops, across much of the country, with the primary aim of ending drugs tourism from neighbouring Belgium, France and Germany.</p><p data-end="683" data-start="387">But an exception was made for Amsterdam, on the condition that the city withdrew licences from coffeeshops located too close to schools. Now, however, there is likely to be a majority in favour of keeping tourists out of the city’s cafes as well, as part of the drive to <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/09/amsterdammers-take-city-council-to-court-to-tackle-over-tourism/">reduce nuisance tourism</a>.</p><p data-end="683" data-start="387"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="838" data-start="685">Mayor Femke Halsema is known to favour a ban and last year the <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/10/amsterdams-pvda-branch-wants-to-ban-tourists-from-coffeeshops/">PvdA said it too</a> would back a ban in the city centre, where most coffeeshops are located. The Liberal democratic party D66 and the left-wing Greens GroenLinks, which are likely to be the biggest parties on the city council alongside the PvdA after the vote, are opposed.</p><p data-end="838" data-start="685">But several other parties support a ban, including the VVD and CDA. And this could make the issue a key part of talks to put together a new coalition after the vote, the <a href="https://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/coffeeshopverbod-buitenlanders-ligt-weer-op-tafel-in-amsterdam-het-zal-een-zegen-voor-de-stad-zijn~b37e2ead/">Parool reported</a> at the weekend.</p><p data-end="838" data-start="685">Halsema has the power to introduce a ban herself but has said she will only do so with council backing.</p><p data-end="838" data-start="685"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1532" data-start="1282">However, experts have raised questions about introducing a ban in Amsterdam. Criminology professor Dirk Korf, who has studied the issue in the south of the country, says it simply won’t work. “Who is going to ensure compliance?” he asked the paper.</p><p data-end="1817" data-start="1534">Korf points out that street dealing flourished before coffeeshops were licensed and warns that it will return under a ban. “There was not a single coffeeshop in Lelystad for a time but a lot of dealers,” he told the paper. “When the first coffeeshop opened, the dealers disappeared.”</p><p data-end="2117" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="" data-start="1819">But Dingeman Coumou from city centre residents’ association d’Oude Stadt told the Parool the paper’s own research suggests fewer tourists will come to the city if a ban is introduced. “In particular those just out to party will stay home, and they are the ones we want to see the back of,” he said.</p></div></div></div></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/amsterdam/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/coffeeshops/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/local-elections/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/local-government/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/tourism/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=263658</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 08:18:02 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item></channel></rss>
