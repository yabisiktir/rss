So how do you reflect on a country where democracy itself is under siege?”</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>The answer? By continuing to do what the JAI does best: providing an independent podium for American culture that aims to bring the best and the brightest American thinkers from the fields of literature, politics, history and technology to the Netherlands.</p><p>In fact, “bringing the best and the brightest of American thinking” was the old slogan. Now, it’s “Amsterdam’s home for independent American thought.”</p><p>“We are independent. We are free-thinking. We believe in democracy and free speech,” says Kenny. “These are our core values, and we’ve decided to lean into them even more outspokenly and brazenly than we have in the past. And I think our <a href="https://www.john-adams.nl/upcoming-events/">programming for the coming year</a> reflects that.”</p><h2><strong>Happy birthday </strong></h2><p>The year 2026 will be a big one for both the JAI and the US: the JAI will turn 40 and the US will celebrate its 250<sup>th</sup> birthday. All the institute’s programming, says Kenny, will be geared to the US<strong>‘ </strong>semi-quincentennial, starting with a <a href="https://www.john-adams.nl/jill-lepore-the-state-of-the-union/">State of the Union address by Jill Lepore</a>, Harvard historian and author of <a href="https://abc.nl/book-details/we-the-people/@9781399827058"><em>We the People</em></a>.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>In addition to historians, the JAI will host poets, writers and politicians to reflect on 250 years of the American experiment, “examining different aspects of what the United States has been, what it is, and what it might yet still become on its 250<sup>th</sup> anniversary since independence,” says Kenny.</p><p>That includes <a href="https://www.john-adams.nl/ada-limon-a-new-national-anthem/">a new national anthem by former US Poet Laureate Ada Limón</a>, and a <a href="https://www.john-adams.nl/michael-pollan-the-inner-republic/">discussion with <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Michael Pollan</a> who looks at the US through the lens of consciousness and hard science.</p><p>“This kind of pattern is the red thread we want to continue throughout the year to look at what issues are facing not only the United States and Americans, but also that wave over the Atlantic Ocean to us here and impact everybody’s lives,” he says.</p><h2><strong>New Amsterdam and Old </strong></h2><p>The US-Dutch connection, one of the longest diplomatic relationships on record, pre-dates the founding of the American republic, when the Netherlands was one of the main financiers of the American Revolutionary War.</p><p>John Adams was tasked with securing a loan from the Dutch, and he lived in Amsterdam for a year and a half before getting it. Today, the Netherlands is among the top foreign investors in the US.</p><p>“The transatlantic connection is always there,” says Kenny. “And we can learn from a still incredibly important country that has shaped the world we live in and still does-for better, worse, and everything in between.”</p><p>The JAI has been able to retain its independence because it relies on donations, entrance fees and private sponsors to support itself—not government subsidies from either the Dutch or the current unpredictable US. That, says Kenny, means the institute is only beholden to its community—“the people who come out and engage with our work.”</p><h2>Keep hope alive</h2><p>That includes Dutch American comedian Greg Shapiro. He cites a recent JAI talk by Minnesota governor and former vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz, who was in Europe as part of a trade mission soon after Donald Trump was sworn in as US president for the second time.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-260473" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_260473" style="width: 560px"><noscript><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-260473" decoding="async" height="433" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/JAI-team-1-by-Michael-Sivolap-e1765287089138-560x433.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/JAI-team-1-by-Michael-Sivolap-e1765287089138-560x433.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/JAI-team-1-by-Michael-Sivolap-e1765287089138.jpg 626w" width="560"/></noscript><img alt="" class="lazyload size-medium wp-image-260473" data-sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" data-src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/JAI-team-1-by-Michael-Sivolap-e1765287089138-560x433.jpg" data-srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/JAI-team-1-by-Michael-Sivolap-e1765287089138-560x433.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/JAI-team-1-by-Michael-Sivolap-e1765287089138.jpg 626w" decoding="async" height="433" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20560%20433%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="560"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-260473">The JAI team of Ian Kenny, Mieke BLeeker and Sean Cotter-Lem.

I found that incredibly relevant and was glad the JAI was there to provide the platform.”</p><p>Native Minnesotan Lynn Kaplanian-Buller was also in the audience. “Walz is my governor, and he’s wonderful,” she says. “His message was that as governors, we are going to work together to make sure authoritarianism doesn’t take over. And that is very encouraging.”</p><p>Kaplanian-Buller is co-owner of The American Book Center (ABC), another independent English-language Amsterdam stalwart. The JAI and ABC recently formed a partnership to grow their like-minded communities.</p><p>“The opportunity arose to fulfil a long-held dream; we have been supporting each other since the beginning,” says Kaplanian-Buller. “We’re sympatico. We also want freedom and speech and ideas and support for the creative processes.</p><p>“We don’t want that to be snowed under by politics in the US. We need the freedom to speak out. We need publishers to publish these books, which have a lot more gravitas than social media. And it’s important to have a podium for that kind of thought, now more than ever.”</p><p>To that end, ABC and JAI are co-hosting a <a href="https://www.john-adams.nl/books-borrel-banter/">Books, Borrel &amp; Banter community night</a> on December 10, where there’s likely to be some commiserating but also plenty of celebrating. “The world outside might be daunting, but I think what we are doing here is rising to that challenge,” says Kenny.</p><p>“In challenging times, it’s important to keep hope alive. We’re looking beneath the headlines and seeing what’s there. We’re shining the light. The future is ours for the shaping.”</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/americans/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/amsterdam/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/art-and-culture/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/dutch-european-news/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/foreign-affairs/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/heritage/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/science/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/united-states/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=260471</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 14:04:49 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Lauren Comiteau]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Bones in sand and at sea solve two missing persons cases</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/12/bones-in-sand-and-at-sea-solve-two-missing-persons-cases/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-260923 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-beach category-missing-person category-society"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Bones in sand and at sea solve two missing persons cases</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2025-12-09T13:55:47+00:00"> December 9, 2025 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-62046" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_62046"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="283" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wind-beach-shells.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wind-beach-shells.jpg 425w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wind-beach-shells-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wind-beach-shells-300x200.jpg 300w" width="425"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-62046"> Photo: Dutch News</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><p data-end="446" data-start="93">Two missing person cases have been solved this year after bone fragments were discovered in or near Dutch waters, news website Nu.nl reported on Tuesday.</p><p data-end="446" data-start="93">A bone found on the beach at Schoorl was identified as belonging to a Belgian national who had been missing for seven years, while a skull recovered north of Schiermonnikoog was linked to a man from The Hague, NU.nl said.</p><p data-end="637" data-start="448">The Belgian bone was found in April by a doctor walking on the beach.
