You want to sell your house for the highest possible price, even if it takes many months. For the agent, however, while a higher price would increase his earnings slightly, it increases his cost a lot and he would be better off if he were to sell your house <em>quickly</em> at a lower price so they can get a slightly reduced commission and move on to the next client. Your interests are mostly aligned, but they aren’t <em>perfectly</em> aligned.</p><p>Now, bring that concept into my office.</p><p>As a financial adviser, I want to believe I always put your needs first. But the traditional business model of financial advice creates a severe principal agent problem.</p><p>The conflict of interest in the typical setup is as follows: an adviser is compensated the moment you agree to become a client. Whether through an upfront fee or a commission, the adviser gets paid immediately.</p><p>This creates a conflict. Onboarding a new client costs the adviser money (staff hours, compliance checks, and administration etc.). If the adviser were to conclude that, after some considerable investment of his time, “You don’t actually need an adviser right now,” he would lose money. Those costs now come with zero revenue.</p><p>But if he were to sign you up even though it were not in your best interest, he covers his costs and makes a profit instantly. In the traditional model, you can never be 100% certain that I or anyone else saying “yes” are doing so because it helps you, or simply because it pays me.</p><p>Breaking the cycle: I believe that to fix this misalignment of interests, we cannot just rely on promises, we have to change the maths. We must create a situation where putting <em>your</em> interests first is the only way to put <em>my</em> interests first.</p><p>That is why we are introducing a new way of doing business.</p><p>The core of this model is simple: The adviser must operate at a loss at the start of the relationship.</p><p>Under this model, we would not charge a large upfront fee that covers all my costs. Instead, the compensation is spread out over time. That would mean that when I spend hours building your financial plan and setting up your accounts, I am essentially investing my own money into our relationship. I am in the red.</p><p>In order for me to recoup my costs, I need to give you good advice and retain you as a client for a reasonable period of time.</p><p>Why this protects you</p><p>By taking on this financial risk, I change my own incentives:</p><ol><li>I cannot afford to give you bad advice. If I recommend a strategy that doesn’t work for you, you will leave. If you leave early, I don’t just lose future profit; I lose the money I spent setting you up as a client.</li><li>I will not onboard you if you don’t need me. If I don’t believe I can provide value to you for the long term, there’s no point in me taking you on as a client. It would be financial idiocy for me to sign you up, do the work, and have you leave in three months. Let’s hope I’m not <em>that</em> much of an idiot?</li></ol><p>Trust shouldn’t be something you have to hope for; it should be baked into the contract.</p><p>That is why Staden Financial Management is officially adopting this model. We are shifting the risk from you to us. We are confident that our advice provides real, long term value, and we are willing to put our own balance sheet on the line to prove it.</p><p>If we don’t deliver value, we don’t just lose a client. We lose money. And that is exactly how it should be.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.stadenfm.com/contact">Contact Luke Staden</a> of <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.stadenfm.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1736245966591000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1WvXKeP7G0CgKxc5DZJMts" href="https://www.stadenfm.com/">Staden Financial Management</a> to set up a meeting and discuss your particular financial needs or check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcS--jlIcox4ludV-ocigwA">YouTube channel</a>.</em></p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/financial-services/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=261550</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 09:39:03 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Traffic congestion increased this year, despite new roads</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/12/traffic-congestion-increased-this-year-despite-new-roads/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-261557 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-accidents category-cars category-traffic"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Traffic congestion increased this year, despite new roads</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2025-12-27T15:48:35+00:00"> December 27, 2025 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-241635" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_241635"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="1333" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Depositphotos_54585927_L.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Depositphotos_54585927_L.jpg 2000w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Depositphotos_54585927_L-560x373.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Depositphotos_54585927_L-1200x800.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Depositphotos_54585927_L-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Depositphotos_54585927_L-768x512.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Depositphotos_54585927_L-1536x1024.jpg 1536w" width="2000"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-241635"> There are 10 million cars on and off the roads Photo: Depositphotos</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><p data-end="290" data-start="76">The total length and duration of traffic jams in the Netherlands increased this year, despite the opening of several new roads in Zuid Holland, figures from the <span class="hover:entity-accent entity-underline inline cursor-pointer align-baseline"><span class="whitespace-normal">ANWB</span></span> show.</p><p data-end="584" data-start="292">The ANWB said traffic congestion – the length of jams multiplied by their duration – rose by 3% compared with last year.</p><p data-end="584" data-start="292">The increase was mainly driven by delays at border crossings, where the outgoing government has introduced more spot checks.

His commute to secondary school – from <a href="https://humanityinaction.org/knowledge_detail/the-bijlmer-a-dutch-approach-to-multiculturalism/">multicultural De Bijlmer</a> to the affluent Oud Zuid in Amsterdam – was by metro. And one day, as a troubled boy who had recently lost his father, he thought about jumping from the platform.</p><p>More than a decade later, Ramdjan is a reporter and chief opinion editor at Dutch newspaper Het Parool and has written a book – “<em>What will people say”</em> – about the contradictions of living in the Netherlands as a minority. He is gay, of Indo-Surinamese origin, one of few from his district to win a place at an elite “gymnasium” school, and brought up in a liberal Islamic household.</p><p>As well as a personal memoir, the book is a political protest about the contradictions of a liberal society that <a href="https://www.ru.nl/services/sport-cultuur-en-ontspanning/radboud-reflects/nieuws/waarom-stoppen-we-mensen-in-hokjes-lezing-en-gesprek-met-psycholoog-gijs-bijlstra-wethouder-cilia-daemen-en-nachtburgemeester-celia-okoro">pigeonholes people</a>, a country that values justice, yet put him on a tax office <a href="https://www.autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/actueel/boete-belastingdienst-voor-zwarte-lijst-fsv">blacklist</a> at 15, after his mother mistakenly overpaid her tax – and an official ticked a box to call it <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2022/05/van-rij-admits-institutional-racism-is-a-problem-at-dutch-tax-office/">a sign of fraud</a>.</p><p>“What do you need to do to be Dutch enough?” wonders Ramdjan at the start of his book, watching the far-right PVV win a quarter of the seats in parliament. “This is my goddamn country. And I’m not going away.”</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>Sitting in an old journalists’ haunt with its name stamped on the biscuits, 27-year-old Ramdjan prefers to see his book as a personal story about identity and belonging – although it is one that unflinchingly points out when the egalitarian self-image crumbles into nasty comments (from a teacher) that he should “go back to the apes in De Bijlmer”.</p><p>“I wrote it for my 13-year-old self…because I didn’t have something like this then,” he says. “So it’s a kind of roadmap. What does it mean to be me, with all these identities? And how do you navigate that?”</p><p>His ancestors were indentured labourers enticed to the Dutch colony of Suriname from India after the abolition of slavery – a group referred to in Dutch as “Hindustani Surinamese”. His well-educated parents emigrated to the Netherlands.</p><p>Gay, and one of a small ethnic minority at his rich, largely-white secondary school, he felt like the odd one out: the contrast between his homosexual identity, rice-eating family and pasta-eating friends became the basis for a long journalistic essay in 2020. Two publishers got in touch and the result is a book, five years later.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>He recounts growing up in a liberal Muslim family where his dad died young, then his struggles to fit in, both in well-to-do society and a judgemental gay community. But, he says, speaking out about prejudice and racism is not universally applauded.</p><p>“It’s hard, because it’s not appreciated if you bring this up,” he says. “[The reluctance to be self-critical] is something that runs very deep with Dutch people.”</p><p>The book is full of references to books he has read, studies and data – he says – as an attempt to show the systematic failure. “We’re a very pragmatic country, and that has brought us a long way,” he says. “Public services are well organised…[but] the risk is that we then fail to have certain essential conversations.”</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261434" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_261434" style="width: 560px"><noscript><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-261434" decoding="async" height="420" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-22-18.02.22-560x420.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-22-18.02.22-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-22-18.02.22-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-22-18.02.22-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-22-18.02.22-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-22-18.02.22-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" width="560"/></noscript><img alt="" class="lazyload size-medium wp-image-261434" data-sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" data-src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-22-18.02.22-560x420.jpg" data-srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-22-18.02.22-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-22-18.02.22-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-22-18.02.22-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-22-18.02.22-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-22-18.02.22-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" decoding="async" height="420" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20560%20420%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="560"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-261434">Tahrim Ramdjan’s book about exclusion and belonging  Photo: S Boztas</figcaption></figure><p>More <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/11/netherlands-get-better-new-show-on-15-years-of-black-activism/">than a decade ago</a>, when protesters started the Kick Out Zwarte Piet movement to protest against racial caricatures and blacking up in the children’s Sinterklaas celebrations, the conversation was unwelcome. “People are quick to say: ‘Keep the atmosphere nice – what’s all the fuss?’ It gets trivialised, it gets relativised, and then you never get to the essential conversation.”</p><p>The <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2024/11/kick-out-zwarte-piet-cancels-demos-as-councils-go-inclusive/">KOZP group, recently disbanded</a>, did make people have an uncomfortable conversation, says Ramdjan – but in other areas of life, prejudice is brushed over. “The thing [is] with racism in the Netherlands—also with landlord discrimination and Islamophobia—it’s all so subtle,” he says. “You get a remark, or a look, or you notice someone treats you differently. But you can’t quite put your finger on it…You can’t prove it.”</p><p><strong>Dogmatism</strong></p><p>Dogmatically seeing racism everywhere isn’t the right response, he says. “There are also people—this is the difficult part of this story—who see racism everywhere, who see disadvantage everywhere. I see it as a division between how you’re treated in daily life. Part of that is based on your personality, your skills, and norms and values. And part of it is those identity attributes you can’t change: colour, class, sexuality, religion, nationality.”</p><p>But he argues for fairness – and seeing each other as individuals rather than jumping to judgement. “Look at queen Máxima: she’s constantly criticised for her accent – the queen of our country,” he points out.</p><p>“Writing this book also felt like a duty. It’s easier to stick your head in the sand…There are people who act like it doesn’t exist. Or they don’t see their own colour. They suppress their sexuality. But I can’t.”</p><p>So writing about it is his reckoning – with homophobia, racism, Islamophobia, classism and prejudice against the neighbourhood where he grew up.  “I’ve tried to adapt and assimilate to a dominant norm in my head, to the community in Oud Zuid, to the Hindustani community,” he says. “But I can’t. It doesn’t work. So this felt like something that had to happen – to make that space.”</p><p><strong>Expat</strong></p><p>Ironically, he also has a sense of how it is to be treated as an “expat” in the Netherlands, because he is often mistaken for one. And yet the thing that draws many people to the country, the much-marketed concept of tolerance, is an identity he hopes the next government will embrace.</p><p>“In 2019 I wrote an opinion piece…where I said: tolerance is one of the values we’ve known since the Enlightenment,” he says. “Why don’t you claim that as Dutch identity? I understand wanting a story of a collective Dutch identity. So take that as a starting point: that tolerance and forbearance are our strength, and that we look at everyone as human.”</p><p>Even if it is a Sisyphean struggle to ask people to have uncomfortable conversations, he believes, putting “the darkness into the light” makes it less intimidating and harder to ignore. “I wanted to show: I’m not seeing ghosts,” he says. “I’m not the only one who sees this. It exists…There’s a sense of calm – recognition – that you’re not alone in the experience.”</p><p>Now, reporting on his city with open eyes and ears as he cycles around, Ramdjan jumps on his bicycle – and is off.</p><p><em>Wat zullen de mensen zeggen was <a href="https://uitgeverijpluim.nl/wat-zullen-de-mensen-zeggen">published</a> in 2025</em></p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/books/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/racism/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/religion/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/society/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=261433</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 08:02:42 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Senay Boztas]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Two frosty days and the Dutch are out in force on their skates</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/12/two-frosty-days-and-the-dutch-are-out-in-force-on-their-skates/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-261540 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-skating category-sport category-weather"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Two frosty days and the Dutch are out in force on their skates</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2025-12-26T10:42:25+00:00"> December 26, 2025 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261541" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_261541"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="667" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-545752040.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-545752040.jpg 1000w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-545752040-560x374.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-545752040-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-545752040-768x512.jpg 768w" width="1000"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-261541"> Photo: Vincent Jannick ANP.</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><p data-end="271" data-start="80">The first speed skating marathon on natural ice this season will be held on Friday evening in Winterswijk, after organisers confirmed late on Thursday that the ice was thick enough to race.</p><p data-end="610" data-start="273">Dutch skating union KNSB had said there was a strong chance of a natural-ice marathon this weekend, but warned that conditions were still uncertain and that Saturday seemed more likely.</p><p data-end="610" data-start="273">However, late on Thursday evening the <span class="hover:entity-accent entity-underline inline cursor-pointer align-baseline"><span class="whitespace-normal">Winterswijkse ice club</span></span> gave the green light for a race on Friday.</p><p data-end="610" data-start="273"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="2084" data-start="1842">Winterswijk also hosted the first natural-ice marathon last year.

You can easily pass a few hours or longer in the Museum de Fundatie before checking out what else the city has to offer in its historic centre, which is surrounded on all sides by a ring of canals.</p><p><a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/07/dutch-destinations-warmond-the-hidden-gem/">Warmond, the hidden gem</a><br/> The Netherlands is full of charming villages that rarely make it into travel guides, places that remain quiet treasures known only to the locals and few other lucky ones. Situated on the banks of the Kagerplassen lake system, Warmond is surrounded by water, greenery, colourful flowers in spring and it features a beautiful country estate that reminds of times gone by.</p><p><a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/05/dutch-destinations-venture-back-into-the-veluwe/">Venture back into the Veluwe</a><br/> Wilderness is a rarity in the Netherlands. This rambling stretch of heathland and forests in Gelderland is about as close as it gets to wide open spaces in this corner of the world. Explore the Veluwe’s trails or visit one the many quaint towns along its edges.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p><a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/03/dutch-destinations-uitwaaien-on-the-wadden-island-of-vlieland/">Uitwaaien on the Wadden island of Vlieland</a><br/> Looking for a quick getaway and to take in some sea air without a long journey or too many other people with the same idea?

But if you’re looking for a way to get fit, up your social life and hang out with some <em>echte </em>Dutchies, then joining a sports club may be the only resolution you need. </strong></p><p>“Every time I move I find a sports club,” says 47-year-old energy executive and lifelong athlete Michelle Lesh. “It’s the quickest way to build community.”</p><p>Originally from the US, the college volleyball player found rowing as an adult. These days you can find her giving lessons on the Amstel River at <a href="https://karzvdehoop.nl/">De Hoop boat club</a> in Amsterdam Oost, one of the country’s oldest.</p><p>“You’re with people week in and week out and build trust and connection so much faster,” says Lesh, who admits to speaking “rowing” Dutch. “You see the cultural similarities. Rowing is rowing. The words may be different, but the sport is the same.”</p><p>Lesh, who moved from Switzerland to Amsterdam in 2021, says rowing has helped her build a strong people network, make business connections and even integrate into Dutch society, including learning how to navigate the Dutch healthcare system.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>“The sports element is common, but sitting with a coffee later is a way to make deeper connections,” she says. “You get access to knowledge with people who want to help you because you’re part of a team.”</p><p>She notes that in Switzerland and the Netherlands, adults are encouraged to join sports clubs, as compared to the US, where you have to seek them out. “It’s normal here, it’s more social,” she says. “You’re kind of expected to stay for a coffee. It’s a more holistic experience.”</p><p>One of her first-time rowing students, Brazilian Jefferson Gomes (33), agrees. “I decided to join the rowing club because I wanted to pick up a sport and feel more integrated into the community. It turned out to be a great decision — I’ve learned a few Dutch words (even if they’re mostly rowing-related!) and met some really nice people.”</p><p>He especially enjoys summer rowing on the Amstel, the many club-organised events and the opportunity to volunteer at races and competitions, “which makes the whole experience even more enjoyable.”</p><h2><strong>Volunteering</strong></h2><p>Volunteering is a big part of sports club life in the Netherlands, especially for smaller organisations that have fewer members and resources than some of the bigger field hockey and football clubs.</p><p>It’s something that parents quickly discover when they sign up their offspring for one of the many Amsterdam hockey or football clubs. Bar shifts and driving to away games are very much part of the job.</p><p>Unlike in many countries, competitive sports for children are arranged around clubs not schools, and they are a place where youngsters often make friends for life.</p><p>Dutch brand and design consultant Theo Lindemann (62) is a cricket player and board member at <a href="https://www.vra.nl/en">VRA Cricket Amsterdam</a>, the country’s largest cricket club. A teenage baseball player, he became fascinated by cricket, but there was none of it in the east of the country when he was growing up. A Dutch friend brought him into VRA 35 years ago, and he hasn’t looked back.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261263" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_261263" style="width: 560px"><noscript><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-261263" decoding="async" height="374" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-560x374.jpeg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-560x374.jpeg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-1200x800.jpeg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-360x240.jpeg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-768x512.jpeg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w" width="560"/></noscript><img alt="" class="lazyload size-medium wp-image-261263" data-sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" data-src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-560x374.jpeg" data-srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-560x374.jpeg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-1200x800.jpeg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-360x240.jpeg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-768x512.jpeg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VRA_Teamphoto2025_45-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w" decoding="async" height="374" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20560%20374%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="560"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-261263">VRA Cricket Amsterdam.

They’ve travelled the world together playing cricket – from Cape Town to Goa to Philadelphia – while here in Amsterdam, they make sure the substantial number of transient international club members feel at home.</p><p>But with only some 450 club members, as compared to 2,500 for a big field hockey organisation, everyone is expected to do their part. And at VRA Amsterdam, a large part of that centres around the clubhouse, which serves as a socialising spot to meet people outside of work and family.</p><p>“The bigger clubs can afford to hire a professional hospitality worker, but the small clubs can’t do that,” he says. Everyone pitches in behind the bar and also helps prepare the grass pitches and take care of the practice nets.</p><p>“The city helps with the maintenance of the fields,” he says, “but we own the pavilion and must maintain it. It’s all volunteers.” After they bought the clubhouse in 2019, a lot of people who couldn’t get to the office because of COVID had time on their hands to help renovate the building at a time when construction work was still allowed. “We needed all the volunteers we could get,” he says. “And we got them.”</p><h2>Beer and <em>bitterballen</em></h2><p>Fellow cricket VRA club member Prasun Bannerjee (45) moved to Amsterdam from Calcutta in 2017 as a highly skilled migrant. He’s one of the club members—some 50% of them—who hail from India or Pakistan.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>“In India, cricket is a religion,” says the systems engineer who dreamed of pursuing cricket as a career when he was young. He applauds the cricket infrastructure in the Netherlands, which helped him meet people and integrate while playing a sport he loved.</p><p>“The social part is very interesting to me,” he says. “A game, some beer, a few <em>bitterballen</em> and a chat. In India, that’s only at the experienced level.”</p><p>While Bannerjee plays competitive cricket, which is all about the sport, he also enjoys the social league, where people come to enjoy the game and camaraderie but don’t get competitively crazy.</p><p>“You get to meet locals and others in the cricket diaspora, which is a mix of ages, skill levels and demographics,” he says. “Especially in the summer, when there are barbeques and dinners and drinks. That’s how friendships develop.”</p><p>Now that it’s winter, club members still train together, play padel and often meet for dinner and game nights at someone’s home. He urges newcomers to join social cricket, which he says is unique to the Netherlands.</p><p>“Our cricket team plays poker during the winter,” he says. “I’m now getting hooked on poker!”</p><h2>Don’t give up!</h2><p>But sometimes finding a sports club can be difficult, says Cathy Leung (52), executive producer of Bram Radio and the Broadcast Amsterdam foundation. The London native moved to Amsterdam 15 years ago with her Dutch husband. She actually met him on a hockey pitch while playing on a corporate club in Britain. Once they moved to the Netherlands, finding a proper hockey club was her priority.</p><p>“I found it difficult to locate one,” she says, “which is surprising because there are so many clubs here. But a lot of people play. It’s a bit who you know here.”</p><p>Leung says not speaking Dutch also hampered her. She bounced around a few hockey clubs trying to find a good fit, and enjoyed playing on Ernst &amp; Young’s corporate club, but, after the birth of her daughter, she traded in her hockey stick for a tennis racquet.</p><p>At the <a href="https://www.tennisclubkattenlaan.nl/">T.C. Kattenlaan</a> tennis club in the Vondelpark, Leung started organising teams and became a captain. She eventually joined the club’s policy-setting committee, which meant her Dutch was up to par.</p><h2>Stand up for yourself</h2><p>“I was forced to speak Dutch, which is right,” she says. “It’s very integrating, learning the rules and settling arguments in Dutch. I’ve made connections and learned how to stand up for myself and not be a passive player.”</p><p>Her advice to those who are club searching in the city? “Don’t give up! There are lots of different clubs,” she says. “Finding and getting onto the right team is challenging. But get a taste of different clubs to get an idea of their culture.”</p><p>For tennis, you can do that via a membership of the <a href="https://www.knltb.nl/">KNLTB</a> tennis association, the umbrella organization for tennis, padel and pickleball in the Netherlands.</p><p>Leung herself has actually found her way back to hockey via tennis through a teammate who invited her to her club. “Sometimes it’s knowing people who open doors,” says Leung. “I went on a ski vacation with my new hockey team. Between tennis and hockey, I have two very strong social networks.”</p><p><em>From baseball to ice hockey, lacrosse to rugby, padel to badminton. Amsterdam has hundreds of team sports clubs.

Self-reliance and resilience are vital, he said, but they cannot exist without community.</p><p data-end="1572" data-start="1435">“Things don’t work without a community in which people look out for one another, listen to one another and support one another,” he said.</p><p data-end="1584" data-start="1574"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1890" data-start="1586">The king spoke at length about parenthood and raising children. Although his daughters are now grown up, he said he still vividly remembered holding a newborn child. “Everything becomes relative, except that tiny being in your arms,” he said. “You want to protect them from all harm and make them happy.”</p><p data-end="2059" data-start="1892">“Children step out into the wider world, and parental love alone cannot protect them from everything,” he said. “You cannot always shield them from pain or misfortune.</p><p data-end="2253" data-start="2061">“So let us do our best to ensure that our world remains a liveable place, where no one stands alone and where the strong have an eye for those who are vulnerable, afraid, lonely or uncertain.”</p><p data-end="2505" data-start="2255">The king finished by referring to the Biblical Christmas story which, he said, “brings us back to the basics. We can all relate to it: a newborn child, a new beginning for us all. The future is open. The light returns. The shortest day is behind us.”</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/royals/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/society/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=261532</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 12:34:19 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item></channel></rss>
