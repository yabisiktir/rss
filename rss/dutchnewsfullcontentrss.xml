Accidents also occur more often at quieter roundabouts. Leiden has relatively few quiet roundabouts, but many where cyclists have priority.</p><p data-end="1446" data-start="1164">Faster cycling speeds are another contributing factor. “We cycle more and faster than before, partly because of e-bikes and fat bikes,” Andriesse said. “Many roundabouts are not designed for cyclists travelling at 25 kph. Motorists often see fast cyclists too late.”</p><ul><li data-end="1446" data-start="1164"><a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/02/going-in-circles-are-dutch-roundabouts-really-that-safe/">Going round in circles: are Dutch roundabouts that safe?</a></li></ul><p data-end="1860" data-start="1448">The design of cycle paths also plays a role. The research shows that roundabouts with two-way cycle paths are slightly safer than those with one-way paths.

In 2020, starters accounted for just 27% of home purchases.</p><p data-end="502" data-start="292">The increase is largely due to government measures aimed at improving access to the housing market, including the exemption from transfer tax and the introduction of buy-to-let restrictions, the Kadaster said.</p><p data-end="790" data-start="504">Another key factor is a sell-off wave by private landlords, who are disposing of their properties because tighter regulation has made renting less profitable. Former rental homes are often smaller and relatively affordable, making them appealing to first-time buyers, the Kadaster said.</p><p data-end="800" data-start="792"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1074" data-start="802">The effect is particularly visible in cities.

In the next 40 largest council areas, almost half of buyers are now purchasing their first home.</p><p data-end="1353" data-start="1076">Nevertheless, the agency points out, average house prices have risen by 43% since 2020, almost twice as fast as average incomes. As a result, many first-time buyers can no longer borrow enough to cover the purchase price.</p><p data-end="1600" data-start="1355">Starters are therefore increasingly forced to use their own savings or other sources of income. Single buyers put an average of €47,000 of their own money into a home this year, while couples contributed around €17,000, reflecting their higher combined borrowing capacity.</p><p data-end="1612" data-start="1602"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1812" data-start="1614">Separate research by ING shows that housing shortages are widening the gap between generations, with more than half of Gen Z respondents saying they are worried about their future housing prospects, the <a href="https://www.ad.nl/wonen/hoe-de-woningnood-de-generatiekloof-vergroot-als-starters-al-een-huis-kunnen-kopen-is-het-40-vierkante-meter~a6fd7f5d/">AD reported on Thursday</a>.

The weight of the seven major US tech firms in their equity portfolios has grown even more sharply: from 7% in January 2020 to 19% in July 2025.
