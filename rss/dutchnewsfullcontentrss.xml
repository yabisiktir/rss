Klaver’s party is also the largest group in the Senate, where the three coalition partners need the support of 16 opposition members to pass legislation.</p><p>However, relations between GL-PvdA and the VVD have soured in the wake of an election campaign in which VVD leader Dilan Yesilgöz claimed the left-wing party GroenLinks had been infiltrated by extremists.</p><p>Yesilgöz had hoped to bring in the right-wing JA21 as a fourth coalition partner, which would have given the cabinet 75 seats, but that option was blocked by Jetten, who said it was “not sensible, given everything that needs to happen”.</p><h2>Spending plans</h2><p>JA21 leader Joost Eerdmans said his party would be constructive, but warned: “If we have to make painful choices, we will need something in return.”</p><p>That is likely to mean concessions on issues such as climate change and immigration, where the progressive-liberal D66 and the hardline conservative JA21 have diametrically opposing views.</p><p>The coalition parties will also face resistance on their spending plans, where they need to make cuts in order to invest in defence to meet the new Nato benchmark of 3.5% of GDP.</p><p>All three parties favour cutting spending on healthcare and welfare, but GL-PvdA’s manifesto included commitments to raise healthcare spending, raise the minimum wage and extend the term for unemployment payments to two years.</p><p>GL-PvdA says the money should be raised instead by increasing wealth taxes and phasing out income tax relief on mortgages – a tax break for homeowners that the VVD has vowed to defend to the hilt.</p><p>Christian Democrat leader Henri Bontenbal suggested that some cabinet posts could be filled by opposition parties, but the idea was immediately dismissed by party leaders.</p><p>Eerdmans called the plan “remarkable”, while Klaver said: “We’re not going to carry out an agreement that we didn’t negotiate.”</p><p>Jan Struis, leader of the pensioners’ rights party 50Plus, also said he was not interested in providing ministers. “We have enough on our plates,” he said.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/cda/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/d66/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/election-2025/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/politics/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/vvd/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=262205</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 15:07:54 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Gordon Darroch]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Czech defence giant plans to list on Amsterdam stock exchange</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/01/czech-defence-giant-plans-to-list-on-amsterdam-stock-exchange/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-262207 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-amsterdam category-business category-defence category-dutch-european-news category-stock-exchange newsletter-include"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Czech defence giant plans to list on Amsterdam stock exchange</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-01-14T14:25:23+00:00"> January 14, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-262208" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_262208"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="717" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EA-RM-70-VAMPIRE_hd.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EA-RM-70-VAMPIRE_hd.jpg 1280w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EA-RM-70-VAMPIRE_hd-560x314.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EA-RM-70-VAMPIRE_hd-1200x672.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EA-RM-70-VAMPIRE_hd-768x430.jpg 768w" width="1280"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-262208"> One of the company's Vampire rocket launch vehicles.

While in 2024 anomalies were reported around the tropics, in 2025 the annual average temperatures reached their highest value in the Antarctic and Arctic regions, and hit record levels in other parts of the world, including north-western Europe.</p><p>“In 2025, half of the global land area experienced more days than average with at least strong heat stress – defined as feels-like temperature of 32° or above,” the researchers say in their report. High temperatures also contributed to abnormal wildfires, which occurred in parts of Europe and North America.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>European scientists attribute the exceptional warming in the last three years to the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the reduced uptake of carbon dioxide by natural sinks, such as forests, soils and oceans.

the number of snow days in the country has been decreasing over the years.</p><p>“We will still have freezing temperatures and snow, but the probability that these happen is going down,” Frank Selten, climate research scientist at weather bureau KNMI told Dutch News. “One way to explain the difference between weather and climate is the weather is like throwing the dice, and the climate determines the probabilities on the dice side.”</p><p>“As the climate is warming”, he said, “we see in the Netherlands an increasing probability of extremely hot days, extreme summer showers, and increasing droughts”.</p><p><strong>Rising sea levels</strong></p><p>“We also see an acceleration of sea level rise due to increasing ice melt and this of course is an important impact for the Netherlands as half of the country is below sea level,” he said. “The country is well aware of the risks and is adapting continuously to reduce its vulnerability.”</p><p>The Dutch government has set up a special commission to strengthen coastal defences and river dykes, and store water to avoid floods in populated areas.</p><p>Nevertheless, Selten said, “perhaps in 100 or 200 years we won’t be able to keep up the defences and will have to give up land or think of alternatives such as living in floating cities.”</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10
