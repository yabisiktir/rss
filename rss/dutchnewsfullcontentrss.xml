discovery of a cow and two cats that<a href="https://www.wur.nl/en/news/first-case-avian-influenza-antibodies-cow-europe"> tested positive</a> for the virus on a Frisian dairy farm.</p><p>An analysis of the milk of the cow was carried out last week when the two cats showed symptoms, and revealed it had recovered from a bout of bird flu.</p><p>According to experts, the spread of bird flu among mammals increases the risk for humans, particularly in such densely populated countries as the Netherlands where animals and people live in close proximity.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden

indicate for the first time that Dutch dairy farms are susceptible to the virus, bird flu expert Thijs Kuiken said. “Until now, we only knew of cows in the United States that had the virus and on a much larger scale, with 1,084 farms in 19 states,” he told the <a href="https://fd.nl/samenleving/1584740/experts-besmette-koe-is-waarschuwing-voor-nieuwe-fase-van-vogelgriep">Financieele Dagblad.</a></p><p>Lab experiments had already shown that variant of the virus was present in European countries but it was assumed that aspects of US dairy farm practices, such as the size of the farms and frequent transports from farm to farm were to blame for the outbreaks.</p><p>One of the reasons the Netherlands has become the second country to have discovered the virus in a cow is a greater emphasis on testing cows on farms close to poultry farms following the American outbreaks, Wageningen University researcher Wim van der Poel told the paper.</p><div class="ad-container

bird flu has become obsolete, Van der Poel said. Seals, foxes, ferrets and cats are just some of the mammals that can carry the virus. “If more species are contaminated the exposure of people to the virus also increases. The virus will also adapt as infections spread. That is worrying and a good reason to monitor infection in mammals,” he said.</p><p>Some 40 of the 71 cases of bird flu in humans in the United States were a result of cow to human contact, Kuiken said. “I am not expecting those numbers in the Netherlands but cows pose an extra risk,” he said. “Brussels must also get is skates on about allowing possible <a href="https://www.dvm360.com/view/european-agency-recommends-marketing-authorization-for-avian-flu-vaccines">vaccines</a>. That would greatly limit circulation.”</p><p>Bird flu <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/12/bird-flu-cull-total-nears-1-6-million-as-more-cases-are-found/">culls</a> in the most recent outbreak numbered have involved killing some 1.7 million birds to date.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/bird-flu/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/farming/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/health/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=262828</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 16:14:32 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Hanneke Sanou]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Government ordered to protect Bonaire from climate change</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/01/government-ordered-to-protect-bonaire-from-climate-change/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-262843 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-caribbean category-climate category-court-cases newsletter-include"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Government ordered to protect Bonaire from climate change</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-01-28T15:17:29+00:00"> January 28, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-262845" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_262845"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="1200" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WhatsApp-Image-2026-01-28-at-15.20.21.jpeg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WhatsApp-Image-2026-01-28-at-15.20.21.jpeg 1600w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WhatsApp-Image-2026-01-28-at-15.20.21-560x420.jpeg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WhatsApp-Image-2026-01-28-at-15.20.21-1200x900.jpeg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WhatsApp-Image-2026-01-28-at-15.20.21-768x576.jpeg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WhatsApp-Image-2026-01-28-at-15.20.21-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w" width="1600"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-262845"> Bonaire residents talk to the media after the ruling.
