There were also protests in The Hague.</p><p>“Our people are so alone in their movement,” says Akbarzadeh, who points out that in the past, when Iran’s marches came to a halt, demonstrations abroad also stopped.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>“This time, however, it is something totally different,” he says. “The Persian community is not leaving the streets of Europe and North America. The mass killings in January have deeply shaken them. We want to keep the public informed.”</p><p>The protesters are also calling for regime change and democracy. Chants of “Go, go, the mullahs must go” and “Trump act now!” could be heard on Dam Square, as Saturday’s protest took place.</p><p>Although Iranian hardliners put the death toll at some 3,000 people last month, Time magazine says “as many as 30,000 people could have been killed in the streets of Iran on Jan. 8 and 9 alone.”</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>Many Iranians in the Netherlands also dismiss the official figures. “Some 7,000 to 8,000 people were killed in my city alone,” says an Iranian Amsterdamer who only wants to give his name as Babak.</p><p>“It’s terrible what happened there and so unfair—shooting people, and so many of them young, 13, 14, 15 years old.

He uses VPNs – many supplied for free by the US – to get people to give their opinions. “We need to measure public opinion anonymously,” he says. “But you can’t have good policy without this information.”</p><p>While many protesters here are pinning their hopes on US president Donald Trump, they say they are angry after he encouraged protesters in Iran to continue taking to the streets, saying “help is on its way.”</p><p>But that help hasn’t come, and Trump’s negotiating with the regime over its nuclear programmes has left a bitter taste in their mouths.</p><h2>Trump did nothing</h2><p>“Trump said he’d react if they killed protesters, and that gave people hope,” says Akbarzadeh. “But Trump didn’t do anything, and many Iranians feel betrayed, although they still hope.”</p><p>Although a month-long internet blackout left many Iranians both at home and in the diaspora in the dark, satellite-streamed images of protests abroad have given people hope, says Maleki.</p><p>His survey has also found increased support for Reza Pahlavi, the son of the last Shah of Iran, over the past three years. While some of the weekend protestors called for the “return of the king,” support is mixed.</p><p>“He’s a symbol,” says Babek. “I’m not sure he’s good for the country, but he’s 100% better than who they have now.”</p><p>The exiled Iranian crown prince is expected to appear in Munich later this month for a February 14 protest he dubbed a global day of action and solidarity with the Iranian people.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/demonstrations/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/iran/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/protest/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/us/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=263437</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 15:33:14 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Lauren Comiteau]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>15 arrested, including four minors, for spreading IS propaganda</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/02/15-arrested-including-four-minors-for-spreading-is-propaganda/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-263432 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-police category-syria category-terrorism newsletter-top-article"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> 15 arrested, including four minors, for spreading IS propaganda</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-02-10T13:35:36+00:00"> February 10, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-232317" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_232317"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="1335" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Depositphotos_342541304_L.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Depositphotos_342541304_L.jpg 2000w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Depositphotos_342541304_L-560x374.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Depositphotos_342541304_L-1200x801.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Depositphotos_342541304_L-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Depositphotos_342541304_L-768x513.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Depositphotos_342541304_L-1536x1025.jpg 1536w" width="2000"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-232317"> Photo: Depositphotos</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><p data-end="282" data-start="181">Dutch police arrested 15 people, including four minors, on Tuesday for encouraging others online to commit acts of terrorism.</p><p data-end="415" data-start="284">The suspects are aged 16 to 53 and the arrests took place nationwide, with most – four – carried out in The Hague.

This would have gone some way in burying those ghosts.</p><p>It was only last week Durham officially announced De Leede’s departure from the club, a conscious decision to focus on white-ball cricket after two stress fractures of the back last season.</p><p>“Over the last year I’ve had two stress fractures in my lower back, which made me think about what kind of cricket I wanted to play,” he said. “And obviously in England there’s a lot of four-day cricket, which I felt like for me was the right time to leave behind and focus on white-ball cricket. So I made the decision to move back to the Netherlands and I’m looking forward to the next couple of years.”</p><p>The Dutch will travel to Chennai tomorrow (Feb 11) for their next game against the USA on Friday at 14:30 CEST.

Diabetesfonds has shown, prompting calls for a national screening.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.demaastrichtstudie.nl/netherlands-cohorts-consortium-ncc">Dutch Cohort Consortium</a>, which pools

makes it clear that one in three people has the disease without knowing about it. “Type 2 diabetes is often called the hidden killer because it develops very slowly and the initial symptoms are vague,
