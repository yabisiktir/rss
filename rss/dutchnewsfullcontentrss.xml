One set of rules resulted in the same wear and tear pattern as was found on the stone.”</p><p>The system may not have found the definitive rules, however, Roemer said. “When fed with a line pattern, Ludij will always find rules,” he said, “but that doesn’t mean the Romans played it in the exact same way.”</p><p>The aim of the game was probably to block the opponent’s tokens, a type of game that was played in the Middle Ages and which has now been found to date from much earlier times, Jeneson said.</p><p>The museum has provided a pdf version of the game which can be downloaded <a href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67cabb313a4e334994b1c5c7/6989be47f306c4d37531a159_Spelregels%20Romeins%20bordspel.pdf">here</a>.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/ai/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/gaming/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/limburg/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/society/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=263466</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 13:44:16 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Hanneke Sanou]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>The Netherlands needs more influencers from the United States</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/02/the-netherlands-needs-more-influencers-from-the-united-states/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-263457 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-expats category-social-media type-column newsletter-include"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> The Netherlands needs more influencers from the United States</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-02-11T13:36:38+00:00"> February 11, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-190854" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_190854"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="427" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_8785.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_8785.jpg 640w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_8785-560x374.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_8785-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_8785-92x62.jpg 92w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_8785-130x87.jpg 130w" width="640"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-190854"> Photo: DutchNews.nl</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Last month, Molly Quell asked in <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/01/an-influx-of-influencers/">her regular column</a> if the Netherlands can survive the onslaught of American influencers.

I can’t hit the thumbs-up button fast enough.</p><p dir="ltr">I was thus excited to read the recent DutchNews column by Molly Quell in which she raises the battle flag against <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/01/an-influx-of-influencers/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1770886359225000&amp;usg=AOvVaw15uzRTvUYU3zDBqTwVrZC-" href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/01/an-influx-of-influencers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“influencers” from the United States moving to the Netherlands</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Quell, a journalist originally from the United States with over 5,000 followers on Bluesky, states that, “far too many of them are documenting their new lives for public consumption, posting about what they find novel or interesting or surprising about their new homelands.”</p><p dir="ltr">Quell goes on to describe these immigrants as “a distinct and lesser category” than immigrants who (like herself) came before, demonstrating that Dutch directness can indeed be acquired.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p dir="ltr">After reading and then rereading Quell’s article, I began writing a long email to the leaders of D66, VVD, and CDA, asking them to revoke all visas for Americans who have more than 5,000 followers (except for Quell, who I see as a sort of whistleblower).</p><p dir="ltr">I considered writing to J21 and PVV, but thought better of it after realising (1) they needed no convincing and (2) were busy organising a private screening of <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ad.nl/buitenland/de-trumps-zetten-alles-op-alles-voor-succes-docu-melania-maar-de-voorvertoning-zorgde-al-voor-wat-ophef~a23557ca/?referrer%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1770886359225000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2lINy4hkkO8bdlxS4EDZXq" href="https://www.ad.nl/buitenland/de-trumps-zetten-alles-op-alles-voor-succes-docu-melania-maar-de-voorvertoning-zorgde-al-voor-wat-ophef~a23557ca/?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Melania</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">But before sending the email, I was seized by doubt. Or maybe just hunger. I grabbed a <em>stroopwafel</em> and walked down the narrow staircase of my apartment to go for a walk. As the orange sky reflected off of the canals, a group of schoolchildren on fatbikes buzzed past me.</p><p dir="ltr">Feeling the need for something savoury to balance the recent rush of sugar, I bought a cone of <em>frites</em> with mayo, sat on a bench, and scrolled through my feed to see the latest wave of posts from Americans living in the Netherlands.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p dir="ltr">Those last sentences show the extent to which I’ve been victimised by these influencers. Did I mention I waited in line for 45 minutes for those <em>frites?</em></p><p dir="ltr">On my walk home, I ignored the bikes, canals, and tulips that surrounded me and instead kept my eyes on the bikes, canals, and tulips on my feed. This is when I noticed something else going on. Something Quell missed.</p><p dir="ltr">Taken together, these attention-seeking, social-media-obsessed strivers are extending Dutch soft power into the devices of millions of Americans. The coordination and efficacy of this operation would make Putin’s bot-farms steam with envy.</p><h2 dir="ltr">More influencers</h2><p dir="ltr">I realised that if we want politics in the United States to tilt closer toward a more peaceful and sustainable global agenda similar to that for which the Dutch lobby in Brussels, we need more of these influencers, not less.</p><p dir="ltr">Don’t believe me?</p><p dir="ltr">Clear your schedule and scroll on social media for an hour. American influencers speak of the Netherlands, and Europe, with admiration and affection, which is far different than the rhetoric coming from the White House.</p><p dir="ltr">Know what influencers especially love? Dutch urban design. This is your chance to influence the very nation whose car-centric lifestyle is most likely to cause the Netherlands to be flooded by rising sea levels.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Salvage Nato</h2><p dir="ltr">What if by welcoming more selfie-stick wielding YouTubers, the Dutch can change the course of American elections, salvage Nato and the EU, and pump the brakes on climate change? Not to mention winning the eternal gratitude of the Italians by relieving their over-touristed cities.</p><p dir="ltr">Dutch power would reach heights not seen since the Golden Age, except this time that power would rest on the free labour of American DAFT visa holders, rather than brutally colonising and exploiting foreign nations.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to American influencers, go ahead, smash that like button.</p><p dir="ltr"><em><span class="il">Chad</span> Lykins moved to Amsterdam in November 2025 from the United States, where he worked in policy, politics, and youth organisations.

A citizen who would never, ever wait in line for 45 minutes for frites. </strong></p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" href="/life-in-the-netherlands/column/"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/expats/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/social-media/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=263457</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 13:36:38 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Lelystad data centre will use “as much electricity as the city”</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/02/lelystad-data-centre-will-use-as-much-electricity-as-the-city/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-263458 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-business category-councils category-energy category-flevoland"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Lelystad data centre will use “as much electricity as the city”</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-02-11T10:39:09+00:00"> February 11, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-94083" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_94083"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="350" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/server-farm.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/server-farm.jpg 500w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/server-farm-300x210.jpg 300w" width="500"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-94083"> Photo: Depositphotos.com</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><p>A blunder by Lelystad local council means the city will be home to a data centre which will use more energy than all local households put together, news website <a href="https://www.nu.nl/klimaat/6385416/datacenter-slurpt-straks-meer-stroom-dan-heel-lelystad-raad-wist-van-niks.html">Nu.nl reported</a> on Wednesday.</p><p>American data centre giant Equinix gained planning permission for the project in 2021, with just the SP and two local parties voting against.</p><p>Councillors were told the centre, to be built at the Flevokust Haven industrial estate, would “not be a huge development”, CDA councillor Jelle Hijmissen told the news platform.
