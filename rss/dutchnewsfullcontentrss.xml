One of the best known is the Ponzi scheme, where people are promised big returns if they bring in new investors whose money is then used as “profits”.</p><p>Boiler room fraud, where victims are cold-called with complex propositions for investments in fake shares and cryptocurrency, is also rife, as is a follow-up fraud in which the scammers pose as lawyers who can recover their money – only to steal more.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>The AFM warned that scams are getting ever more sophisticated, with AI producing near-perfect fake websites and videos in which celebrities recommend investments. “It is getting easier and cheaper. You can buy ready-made scams on the dark web,” she said.</p><p>Victims are usually older people wanting to supplement their pensions, working people who want a better return on their savings and young people falling for get-rich-quick schemes.</p><p>“People are gradually sucked into something they should leave well alone,” Van Geest told broadcaster NOS. “But all those pretty stories give people hope and make them perhaps a bit greedy,” she said. “You lose sight of the red flags and become a victim.

As long as the treatment is covered by the policy, all clients pay is the monthly fee: €166.80 next year, or €184.80 for the premium package, which includes dental care and physiotherapy.</p><p data-end="2578" data-start="2445">It’s a simple idea, and one less thing for clients already grappling with the vagaries of the Dutch healthcare system to worry about.</p><p data-end="2970" data-start="2580">Another common question concerns children. “New arrivals often tell me they are shocked by how expensive health insurance seems, but they don’t realise that children are insured for free,” Janice says. “Parents don’t pay any premium for their children until the age of 18, although they should register them with the health insurance company to make sure they are in the system.”</p><p data-end="3005" data-start="2972"><strong data-end="3005" data-start="2972">Freedom to choose your doctor</strong></p><p data-end="3334" data-start="3007">Freedom of choice about which doctors, hospitals and clinics you can visit is another area that often causes confusion. To receive maximum reimbursement it is important to choose or visit a contracted healthcare provider. If you go to a hospital with which the insurer has no contract, you could end up with an unexpected bill.</p><p data-end="3580" data-start="3336">Glider Insurance, by contrast, covers care in every public hospital in the country. The company offers an in-kind policy, which means invoices are sent directly to the insurance company and clients do not have to deal with the bills themselves.</p><p data-end="3944" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="" data-start="3582">“If you go to a non-contracted care provider or clinic with whom the insurance company has no contract, then you will pay part of the invoice out of your own pocket,” Janice points out.</p><p data-end="3944" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="" data-start="3582">“After all, if as an expat you are having to deal with a health issue in a foreign country, it makes sense to keep your insurance as simple and easy to understand as possible.”</p><p><em><strong>Find out more about <a href="https://www.gliderinsurance.nl/?utm_source=DutchNews&amp;utm_medium=article">Glider Insurance’s special packages for expats</a> or check out their <a href="https://www.gliderinsurance.nl/help-center-expat-insurance-netherlands/?utm_source=DutchNews&amp;utm_medium=article">FAQs for more information</a>.</strong></em></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/uncategorized/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=261002</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 08:13:37 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Late turnaround in Baku ends Ajax’s Champions League drought</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/12/late-turnaround-in-baku-ends-ajaxs-champions-league-drought/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-260998 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-ajax category-champions-league category-football category-sport"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Late turnaround in Baku ends Ajax’s Champions League drought</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2025-12-10T21:35:40+00:00"> December 10, 2025 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-260999" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_260999"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="1707" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-544515778-scaled.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-544515778-scaled.jpg 2560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-544515778-560x373.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-544515778-1200x800.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-544515778-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-544515778-768x512.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-544515778-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-544515778-2048x1366.jpg 2048w" width="2560"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-260999"> Scorers Anton Gaaei of Ajax (l) and Qarabag‘s Camilo Duran contest the ball.

Dolberg went close when he rounded off a move that was begun by goalkeeper Viteszslav Jaros by shooting into the side netting.</p><p>The home side responded by going ahead when Camilo Duran profited from a moment’s indecision by defender Ko Itakura to steal in and loft the ball over the advancing Jaros.</p><p>Dolberg had another opportunity after 20 minutes when Anton Gaaei made space on the right before squaring to the striker, but his shot sailed high over the crossbar.</p><h2>Qarabag threat</h2><p>Qarabag continued to pose a threat and should have had a second when Abdellah Zoubir found the ball at his feet in front of goal, but the French striker screwed his attempt wide.</p><p>Ajax went level six minutes before the interval as Dolberg picked up a ball from Steur on the left side, evaded three advancing defenders and struck a shot from 20 metres that flew past the goalkeeper’s right hand.</p><p>But two minutes after the break the Azeri side were back in front as a succession of blunders allowed Matheus Silva to hit a shot from the edge of the area that Ajax’s Lucas Rosa deflected past Jaros into the net.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light

on another teenage debutant, Don-Angelo Konadu, for Dolberg in the 78th minute, and the Dutch-Ghanaian made an immediate impact, running onto a low cross by Mika Godts only to hit his shot straight at Mateusz Kowalski.</p><p>Ajax equalised a minute later when Oscar Gloukh jinked past two defenders and found the bottom corner from the edge of the penalty area.</p><p>Four minutes later Ajax broke out of their own penalty area and Konadu laid the ball on for Danish defender Anton Gaaei to hit a swerving shot past the diving Kowalski.</p><p>And as the hosts poured forward in search of an equaliser, Godts strolled up the other end and picked out Gloukh, who rolled in the fourth through the goalkeeper’s legs.</p><p>The result lifts Ajax off the bottom of the Champions League table to 33rd place, with a trip to fellow strugglers Villarreal and a home fixture against Olympiakos still to come.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10
