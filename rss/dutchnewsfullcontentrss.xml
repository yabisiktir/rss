Last year the <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2024/11/its-almost-time-to-reconsider-your-health-insurance-package/">average monthly increase was €12</a>. However, some insurers have frozen their fees and others are actually reducing them.</p><p>The difference between the cheapest and most expensive insurance policy is €511 and the own risk payment remains €385, but you can increase this in return for lower premiums.</p><p>Very little is changing in the provisions of the basic health insurance policy. However, if stopping smoking is one of your New Year resolutions, you will be able to take part in  three programmes to help you quit next year rather than one.</p><p>“Finding the right <a href="https://www.independer.nl/zorgverzekering/info/health-insurance">health insurance policy</a> might seem complicated, but it is usually much easier than you’d expect,” says Independer health expert Youri van der Avoird. “Our comparison tool gives you a clear and complete overview of the options and takes you by the hand to ensure you find the most fitting health insurance for you.”</p><h2>Cheapest deal</h2><p>The cheapest deal, according to comparison website Independer, is €142.40 a month, offered by VinkVink. Nationale-Nederlanden has a “natura” policy for €142.45, while United Consumers, VGZ and Univé all have a basic policy on offer for €147.40.</p><p>One way of further reducing the basic tariff is to increase your own risk element to €585 or €885. That means you pay the first €585 or €885 of your healthcare costs in a given year. Worth knowing – visits to your family doctor and costs relating to childcare and childbirth are exempt.</p><p>If you need regular medicine, have a chronic health condition, expect to need medical treatment or have a hospital appointment, it will not be worth increasing your own risk. But if you are in good health it is definitely something worth thinking about.</p><p>Increasing it by €500, for example, will cut the amount you pay in health insurance over the year by up to €260 – money which Youri recommends you save up anyway – just in case the unexpected happens.</p><p>Apart from price, what other things should you think about when making up your mind whether or not to change health insurer next year?</p><h2>Free choice of hospital</h2><p>You also need to decide if you want to be able to visit any healthcare provider you like or, if you don’t mind being limited to the providers your insurance company has contracts with.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.independer.nl/zorgverzekering/info/soorten/combinatiepolis">combinatiepolis</a> gives you the most freedom of choice and can usually visit almost all healthcare providers. However for some types of care, such as mental health services,  you will have to pay part of the bill yourself. This can range from 10% up to 50% of the invoice.</p><p>If you go for a natura policy, you must look carefully at the contracts your insurer has with healthcare providers. If you go to a non-contracted provider, the insurer will not reimburse the full bill and you will often have to pay between 20% and 40% of the costs yourself.</p><p>A budget natura policy means more restrictions on the number of hospitals, clinics and physiotherapists you can visit and again, you will have to pay part of any non-contracted care yourself.</p><p>Independer’s comparison website allows you to add the healthcare providers of your choice so you only see insurers that you know for sure have a contract with the hospital or clinic you want.</p><h2>Total cost</h2><p>Now the rates for supplementary insurance have been finalised, you can get a complete picture of what costs and services you face.</p><p>Remember, the <a href="https://www.independer.nl/zorgverzekering/info/health-insurance/system/basic-health-insurance">basic health insurance</a> does not cover physiotherapy, dental care, opticians and alternative medicine so you need to think carefully about whether or not you need these services. If your teeth are in good condition, for example, dental insurance may not be financially worth it.</p><p>Don’t forget: you have until December 31 to tell your old insurer you are leaving and until January 31, 2026 to sign up with a new one. If you’ve found a new insurer before the end of the year, they will sort out all the paperwork for the changeover on your behalf.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/healthcare/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/insurance/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=260526</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 10:39:12 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Morgan Stanley fined €101 million for avoiding Dutch tax</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/11/morgan-stanley-fined-e101-million-for-avoiding-dutch-tax/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-260539 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-banking category-court-cases category-financial-services"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Morgan Stanley fined €101 million for avoiding Dutch tax</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2025-11-28T09:35:55+00:00"> November 28, 2025 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-260540" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_260540"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="667" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Depositphotos_817784260_S.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Depositphotos_817784260_S.jpg 1000w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Depositphotos_817784260_S-560x374.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Depositphotos_817784260_S-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Depositphotos_817784260_S-768x512.jpg 768w" width="1000"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-260540"> Photo: Depositphotos.com</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><p data-end="69" data-start="0">The Dutch public prosecution service has fined US investment bank Morgan Stanley <a href="https://www.om.nl/actueel/nieuws/2025/11/27/geldboete-101-miljoen-voor-morgan-stanley-wegens-dividendbelastingontduiking">€101 million for avoiding dividend tax</a> in the Netherlands through a structure that gave it an unlawful tax advantage.</p><p data-end="508" data-start="265">Morgan Stanley agreed to the penalty “shortly before the start of the criminal trial”, the public prosecution service said.
