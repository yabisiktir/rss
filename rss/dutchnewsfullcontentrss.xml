Underneath the top layer of paint, on a much smaller original canvas, his bull had dramatically larger testicles.</p><p>“During the technical examination, we found that Potter made lots and lots of changes as he worked, and not only to the composition. He literally enlarged the canvas,” said Abbie Vandivere, one of the paintings conservators at the Mauritshuis in The Hague.</p><p>“It started as a smaller composition, just a painting of a bull, maybe with the cow in it. When he made the composition bigger, he made a ton of changes, also to parts of the bull’s anatomy…His balls were bigger and lower.”</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>Although this was a “big surprise” to the painting experts, they could only guess whether it was a correction or the result of the young painter sketching from real life in the fields – but then modifying his design to the national sensibilities of 1647.</p><p>“We have consulted quite a few cow experts and there are definitely breeds of cow that have giant, pendulous testicles,” she said. “It also depends on the age of the bull: of course, when they are younger, they’re still forming, and this is supposed to portray a young bull.”</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-262213" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_262213" style="width: 560px"><noscript><img alt="" class="wp-image-262213 size-medium" decoding="async" height="417" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-12-12.56.58-scaled-e1768402583511-560x417.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-12-12.56.58-scaled-e1768402583511-560x417.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-12-12.56.58-scaled-e1768402583511-1200x893.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-12-12.56.58-scaled-e1768402583511-768x572.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-12-12.56.58-scaled-e1768402583511-1536x1143.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-12-12.56.58-scaled-e1768402583511.jpg 1720w" width="560"/></noscript><img alt="" class="lazyload wp-image-262213 size-medium" data-sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" data-src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-12-12.56.58-scaled-e1768402583511-560x417.jpg" data-srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-12-12.56.58-scaled-e1768402583511-560x417.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-12-12.56.58-scaled-e1768402583511-1200x893.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-12-12.56.58-scaled-e1768402583511-768x572.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-12-12.56.58-scaled-e1768402583511-1536x1143.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-12-12.56.58-scaled-e1768402583511.jpg 1720w" decoding="async" height="417" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20560%20417%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="560"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-262213">The exhibition includes an explanation of the restorers’ discoveries.

It is part of a project to find out more about a talented artist who died of tuberculosis at just 28, and remind the public of what was once considered a national masterpiece.</p><p>The Bull was one of the paintings belonging to William V that were <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2023/09/french-still-have-70-paintings-looted-from-the-dutch-by-napoleon/">looted from the Netherlands</a> in the Napoleonic era, and taken to form part of the collection of what would become the Louvre. As the Netherlands became a vassal state of France and Willem fled to England in 1795, the French carefully labelled his 194 paintings and shipped them – without even rolling up The Bull – to Paris.</p><p>There, it was considered a star attraction. “They loved it,” said Schilder, “and the fact that it wasn’t allegorical. It means nothing more than a group of animals in a landscape. They copied it, they made prints of it, they adored it, but they also restored it.”</p><p><strong>Symbolic</strong></p><p>After armed Dutch troops turned up in 1815 – with stories of the French hiding the ladders of the Louvre in order to frustrate the Dutch attempt to reclaim this large painting – The Bull was brought back to the Netherlands in a triumphal procession.</p><p>Although it is now less well known than, for example, Vermeer’s Girl with a Pearl Earring, in the 19th century it came back in a triumphal procession. Its one human character, the farmer, even became one of the illustrations in a standard guide to teach all children in the Netherlands to read.</p><p>“It kind of became a symbol of the entire country, because it’s so relatable to the Dutch to have a cow and a bull,” said Vandivere. “It’s about reproduction, but also about agriculture, economics…even manure.”</p><p>After painstakingly removing the old, yellowing varnish and layers of overpainting from four previous restorations, the experts carefully decided which changes to cover up and which to repair.</p><p>A “French branch”, added in Paris, was overpainted, for example. While they were discovered during scanning, the original bull’s testicles remain hidden as Potter intended – apart from in a separate display to visitors.</p><p>A new exhibition is now planned for 2027 to reintroduce the Dutch public to Potter and The Bull. “We call it,” said Schilder, “our Moona Lisa.”</p><p><em>A <a href="https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/what-s-on/exhibitions/a-peek-at-potter">Peek at Potter</a> is currently on show at the Mauritshuis</em></p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/art-and-culture/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/museums/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/society/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=262206</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 09:43:26 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Senay Boztas]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Forecasters say chilly weather is set to return later this month</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/01/forecasters-say-chilly-weather-is-set-to-return-later-this-month/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-262248 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-snow category-society category-weather"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Forecasters say chilly weather is set to return later this month</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-01-15T09:42:16+00:00"> January 15, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-208196" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_208196"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="1200" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-1.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-1.jpg 1600w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-1-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-1-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-1-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-1-640x480.jpg 640w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-1-83x62.jpg 83w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-1-130x98.jpg 130w" width="1600"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-208196"> A frosty Vondelpark in Amsterdam.
