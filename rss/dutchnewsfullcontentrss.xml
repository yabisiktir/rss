That was 18 years ago. A three year degree in Maastricht turned into a master’s degree followed by training followed by a lot of other things and I just stayed.</p><p>I remember researching my career options. I thought about what I wanted to do after the bachelor’s, what was a possible master’s, what was a possible job in which country and in which language, and somehow the answers all pointed to the Netherlands.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>How do you describe yourself – an expat, lovepat, immigrant, international?</strong>None of the above. I think I’m too German to be Dutch and too Dutch to be German. People try to place me in a box based on my behaviour, outfit, or accent… and usually fail. So let’s keep it simple: I’m European. Or even better, just human.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>I spent one of my high-school years in New Zealand when I was 16. That had an influence on my development and then I went back to Germany. That was followed by university in the Netherlands and then I did half a year on Aruba to improve my Dutch skills.</p><p>Whenever you move to a different country, you take something different with you and you pick up new things. You learn, you grow, and you take some part of that language and that culture with you.</p><p><strong>How long do you plan to stay?<br/> </strong>Potentially forever. Time will tell, but for now I genuinely enjoy living here. The Netherlands still feels like the right mix of familiar and foreign in all the best ways.</p><p>And all the adult things for me have happened here; things like buying a house, doing a mortgage, tax declarations, and insurances. If I went to any other country, I would have to learn how to do those all over again. That can be exciting, that can be fun, but it would be a challenge and this feels like home.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p><strong>Do you speak Dutch and how did you learn?<br/> </strong>I do now, yes. My first student job was wrapping presents in a ICI Paris perfume shop during the Christmas rush. I learned exactly one sentence and one sentence only: ‘<em>Is het een Sinterklaas of kerstcadeau</em>?’ [‘is it a Sinterklaas or Christmas present?’]</p><p>I had to wrap all the presents and would say ‘hello’ to each customer before asking them the question and trying to chose the right type of paper. Thankfully, there was a third neutral type I could use when I didn’t understand what they were saying.</p><p>It was really learning by doing and in that type of job people love to talk to you. Customers told me long stories about the weather, their aunt, their dog, why they picked this perfume, and I just smiled and nodded because I didn’t understand a word. Step by step though, I picked up words. It was a paid course in the sense I was learning Dutch and getting paid to do it.</p><p>And I did do one class, but I found it really useless. You learn things like ‘Hi, my name is Sabine and I’m from Germany. My hobbies are…’ It’s not how anyone speaks. So I learned through e-studying and jobs instead. I did a lot of waitressing too, but then I started studying Dutch law, which is quite an upgrade from perfume vocabulary. I learned so many words no normal person would ever use in real life.</p><p><strong>What’s your favourite Dutch thing?<br/> </strong>The<em> borrel</em> for so many random reasons. People here will get together for drinks for anything. Ooh, it’s a birthday. Ooh, it’s nice weather. Ooh, a colleague bought a hamster. It can be absolutely random, but they’ll find a reason to celebrate life, have a drink with people, and have some snacks with that. I like it.</p><p><strong>How Dutch have you become?<br/> </strong>There are very Dutch things about me, but there are things I’ll never ever want to do, accept, or understand. I do bike everywhere, the obvious one, and I do take paracetamol for a few days before daring to call the doctor. That’s the culture here, which is very different from where I come from.</p><p>I also go outside in any type of weather and use the informal form of ‘you’ in Dutch with basically anyone I meet. It’s always the first name approach, whether that’s someone on the street, the CEO of a company, or whoever. There’s no hierarchy in that sense.</p><p>But one thing I still find very weird is this whole birthday thing where you come in and congratulate everyone. If it’s my friend Anna’s birthday, people will congratulate me even though it’s Anna’s birthday. I fail to understand that.</p><p>At a party, you’ll congratulate the parents, and I do get that part. They made the person. That’s great, awesome, but anyone else? A neighbour? A friend? I don’t get it. I won’t do it. I say ‘hi’ and then excuse myself. It’s where I draw the line.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Which three Dutch people (dead or alive) would you most like to meet?</strong></p><p>Cabaretier<strong> Lisa Loeb. </strong>She talks about femicide and she does it in a really confronting and honest kind of way, which I find impressive and important. Topics like these shouldn’t be funny, but the way she exposes society’s blind spots is brilliant.</p><p>Amsterdam mayor<strong> Femke Halsema.</strong> I like people who show integrity in a human kind of way. She’s a politician who doesn’t just go where the wind blows, who actually stands for something, and tries to find connections between people, no matter their background or belief system. She brings nuance and humanity into tough conversations.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Anne Frank. </strong>Her writing still shapes how we understand an entire period of history.<strong> </strong></p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-251949" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_251949" style="width: 560px"><noscript><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-251949" decoding="async" height="420" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0071-560x420.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0071-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0071-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0071-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0071-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0071.jpg 2016w" width="560"/></noscript><img alt="" class="lazyload size-medium wp-image-251949" data-sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" data-src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0071-560x420.jpg" data-srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0071-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0071-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0071-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0071-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0071.jpg 2016w" decoding="async" height="420" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20560%20420%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="560"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-251949">Fenix’s “Suitcase Labyrinth” features 2,000 donated suitcases.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>What’s your top tourist tip?<br/> </strong>They should go to Fenix, the museum of immigration in Rotterdam. It emphasises how everyone is an immigrant. We have this idea that immigrants are either refugees or people who are merely looking for luck. When you go there, you’ll see that everyone’s story, if you go a bit further back, is always all about immigration. People move. It’s part of the DNA of human beings. I really like that. It’s a different perspective and they offer it in a kind of fun way.</p><p>And if they’re already in Rotterdam, they can make a day of it: take a boat across the river, wander through the Markthal, or try one of the many small restaurants that make the city feel so alive.</p><p><strong>Tell us something surprising you’ve found out about the Netherlands.<br/> </strong>Everyone speaks English at a pretty decent level, which makes you think everything here is easy since everyone speaks English, but the moment you need to talk about scary adult things, suddenly it’s no longer possible to speak in English.</p><p>Tax returns, insurances, notary deeds, and court hearings? You suddenly need a Dutch interpreter for things like these that really matter. That language gap is exactly why I started <a href="https://counselr.nl/">Counselr</a>. And, yes, it’s a long road, but someone has to make the legal system more accessible for internationals.</p><p><strong>If you had just 24 hours left in the Netherlands, what would you do?<br/> </strong>One massive, 24 hour straight <em>borrel</em>. Life here is all about the people you meet, right? As much as you might enjoy a city, buildings, nature, or whatever you’re into about the country, at the end of the day, it’s about the people you meet, how they treat you, and how they welcome you. Because I feel at home here, I would want to invite everyone who has crossed my path in the past 18 years and share memories while having a good <em>borrel </em>together.</p><p><em>Visit </em><a

part of a plan to deal with the housing crisis in Europe and boost the availability of affordable homes.</p><p>Housing is considered to be an area of national competence but the EU executive says that “with an average increase of house prices by more than 60%, and of rents by more than 20% in the past 10 years, millions of Europeans are struggling to find a home they can afford”.</p><p>This “hurts labour mobility, access to education, and family formation,” the commission said.</p><p>The package of measures announced on Tuesday aims to increase housing supply through more investment, planning and reforms, and support for innovative construction and renovation.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex

id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>A key element of the plan is the relaxation of EU state aid rules, which were designed to prevent national governments from giving financial advantages to companies in order to avoid unfair competition.</p><p>The commission proposed to revise the rules to include affordable housing in some categories and so make it easier for member states to support affordable and social housing projects.</p><p>Utrecht housing chief Dennis de Vries said the change in state aid rules is crucial. “Every country is different, and national competences vary across member states,” he said. “To make it work, you have to account for the differences in Europe.”</p><p>The relaxation of state aid rules will make it easier for the Dutch government to support housing corporations, which are the primary providers of social housing in the country.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none

and holiday rentals “in areas under housing stress”.</p><p><a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/07/holiday-rentals-plunge-in-amsterdam-but-grow-overall-in-nl/">Short-term rentals across Europe</a> grew by almost 93% between 2018 and 2024, and in popular destinations they now represent 20% of the housing stock, the commission said.</p><p>“We cannot sit back while local citizens are pushed out of the housing market in the places where they were born or where they want to build their life,” energy and housing commissioner Dan Jørgensen said, while announcing the plans in the European parliament.</p><p>“Short term rentals is, as such, not a bad idea,” he said. ‘For some people the income they can get from renting out their homes might be what actually makes it possible for them to stay in their home… but when we see people not being able to live in certain areas of a city because prices have gone up pushed by short term rentals… then, of course, it is a problem”.</p><p>The new rules will address competition between professional hosts with traditional accommodation providers, who have to comply with stricter safety and consumer protection requirements, the commission said.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2023/11/watershed-moment-new-eu-rules-on-airbnb-style-rentals-agreed/">existing EU regulation</a> becoming effective in May 2026 requires the registration of hosts and the sharing of data with national authorities.</p><p><strong>House prices</strong></p><p>Jaume Collboni, mayor of Barcelona and deputy president of Eurocities, the organisation representing cities in Brussels, said the plan “represents a turning point for Europe’s housing crisis.”</p><p>According to the commission analysis, housing demand in the EU is expected to grow by more than two million units per year, mainly in urban areas. One million homes will be needed in the Netherlands by 2031.</p><p>In several European cities essential workers, such as teachers, nurses and police officers, cannot afford to live in the communities where they work and young people are pushed out of the market, the commission noted.</p><p>Only three member states – the Netherlands, Austria and Denmark – have more than 20% of their housing stock classified as social housing.

Photo: RobinFotografie.nl</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><p>If your bank has turned you down for a mortgage because you are an international, receive income from abroad or have business history abroad, do not despair!</p><p>That’s the message from Wouter Hofstee Holtrop, an expert in “complex cases” and partner at Expat Mortgages. Depending on where you come from, you might be used to entrepreneurial income being treated as an extra risk for loans – or not.</p><p>But in the Netherlands, many banks are used to dealing with simple cases: people in regular employment or on a temporary contract with a declaration from their employer to renew it.</p><p>“What is complex income? It depends on who you speak to,” says Hofstee Holtrop. “Some companies work with net income; it can mean everything foreign. Complex is everything that’s not standard regular employment in the Netherlands, because that’s what every broker can close.”</p><h2>A safe bet</h2><p>But even if you have been turned down by your bank, you should be aware that a mortgage broker who really understands global finance and entrepreneurship can often build a story to convince a mortgage lender that you are, in fact, a safe bet.</p><p>Expat Mortgages, a specialist in getting mortgages for thousands of internationals, boasts an even lower rate of people defaulting on their payments than the norm in the Netherlands.</p><p>“The default rate in the Netherlands is already insanely low in comparison to other countries like the US, at 0.4%,” he says. “Our clients have a default rate that’s even lower, because the last thing a foreign client wants to default on is their mortgage.”</p><p>The first thing to know is if you have income that differs from the norm, you should expect to pay more of a down payment for a house. Expat Mortgages typically works only with entrepreneurs who can put down 15% of the purchase price in cash, and who are also prepared to pay a slightly higher fee to cover checking foreign documentation.</p><h2>Documents in order</h2><p>You will also need to have everything in order well in advance, so that you can go through a pre-approval process to know what your allowable income will be judged to be – before you start house hunting.</p><p>One thing that will be considered is the currency in which you are paid. “We build in security for currency risk in the income and on average we use 10% less than the income we really think we can declare,” says Hofstee Holtrop.</p><p>“If we have an average income with all of the necessary corrections for €100,000 equivalent, we tell the bank we will only use 90%. And you really need to have a minimum of €70,000 or €80,000 to get entrepreneurial income from abroad approved because otherwise the risk just becomes too big.”</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-253300" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_253300" style="width: 560px"><noscript><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-253300" decoding="async" height="420" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2761-560x420.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2761-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2761-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2761.jpg 1000w" width="560"/></noscript><img alt="" class="lazyload size-medium wp-image-253300" data-sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" data-src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2761-560x420.jpg" data-srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2761-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2761-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2761.jpg 1000w" decoding="async" height="420" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20560%20420%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="560"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-253300">Photo: Dutch News</figcaption></figure><p>There are myths too around being a freelancer. Many people assume you must produce three years of income in the Netherlands, but this isn’t necessarily the case if you can build the right story about your track record in another country, in an industry that easily transfers.</p><h2>Freelancing</h2><p>“If you’re a medical doctor, even though the numbers were historically the same, we cannot use your previous income because we cannot guarantee that you can do the same work, in a different time zone, in a different country,” he says. “But we have had full entrepreneurial income approved for someone with four years’ history in the US and two months in the Netherlands. The story matters a lot.”</p><p>Expat Mortgages now has a team that deals with complex income, made up of <span lang="en-NL">Wouter and new arrival Paul van der Weide, a former senior entrepreneurial specialist at one of the big three banks. </span>They are experts in the kind of official documents that can prove your taxable earnings elsewhere, and will be accepted by Dutch banks.</p><p>“It’s just not correct that you always need a trading history of three years,” Wouter says. “The minimum banks tell clients is one year, but it is possible to vary this with case-by-case approval.”</p><h2>What you need</h2><p>You will need balance sheets, profit and loss statements, government tax documents and everything properly checked by a chartered accountant. It is also wise to think about where your savings are, how quickly you can get them to the Netherlands, and the risk of the exchange rate changing by the time you want to make an offer on a house.</p><p>If you have property abroad or mortgages abroad, this is not necessarily a problem if you are honest and built the right case around your income for a mortgage lender.</p><p>Expat Mortgages helps scores of clients each year with “complex” situations, carries out its own thorough anti-fraud checks and only presents clients to mortgage lenders who meet all the checks.</p><p>“We’re fully behind it, otherwise we don’t send it to the bank,” he says. “People at the banks normally don’t know the possibilities for exceptions – they know the standard cases. We often see people getting told no, which in 95% of cases is not true.

The CDA’s support is needed to pass the bill through the lower house, while the SGP have a pivotal position in the senate.</p><p>But on Monday, CDA MP Bart van den Brink told a committee hearing that his party was prepared to back the bill after foreign affairs minister, David van Weel, reassured MPs that people who helped refugees would not face prosecution.</p><h2>Revolving door</h2><p>Van den Brink said Van Weel’s efforts had fixed “a lot of problems with implementation”. “This is a form of criminalisation that the CDA has supported for a long time: before the elections, during the elections and afterwards,” <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2594715-demissionair-kabinet-lijkt-strafbaarheid-illegaliteit-toch-over-de-streep-te-trekken">he added</a>.</p><p>The CU, as well as the progressive-liberal D66, had called for the idea of criminalising illegal residency to be scrapped altogether.</p><p>Local authorities, police and the immigration service IND have warned of a revolving door effect if asylum seekers are jailed for refusing to leave and face being arrested again on their release.</p><p>D66 MP Jan Paternotte said the revised bill risked creating extra work for the immigration service, comparing it to “a dog chasing its own tail and ending up biting it.”</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>D66 are in negotiations to form a new government with the CDA and the right-wing liberal VVD, but Van Weel, a VVD minister, <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/11/minister-wants-controversial-asylum-laws-passed-by-christmas/">wants to pass the legislation before the new cabinet takes office</a> to avoid a “big problem”.</p><p>Other left-wing opposition parties also criticised the bill. GroenLinks-PvdA MP Lisa Westerveld said it was “falling apart at the seams” and was being rushed through parliament.</p><p>Christine Teunissen of the animal rights party PvdD was concerned that refugees would refuse medical treatment if they risked being arrested.</p><p>The far-right PVV had also threatened to vote against the law if its proposals were watered down, but MP Marine Vondeling said in Monday she was prepared to accept the compromise. “We’re not going to block criminalisation,” she said.</p><p>ChristenUnie MP Don Ceder said Van Weel had failed to explain to MPs how the law would have any practical benefits or address issues such as the impact on prison capacity.
