Van Weel could not exclude certain forms of help to be criminalised while allowing it in other cases.</p><p>It said the government had not taken sufficient care in drafting the law criminalising aid to illegal refugees and advised Van Weel to introduce a separate bill instead.</p><p>The PVV amendment was only passed as the result of a blunder by MPs for parties who opposed it, who tried to make use of the pairing system because the vote took place on the same day as Keti Koti, the annual commemoration of slavery.</p><p>One MP for the left-wing alliance GroenLinks-PvdA paired with a colleague from NSC, which supported the bill but opposed the amendment. That left opponents of the amendment a crucial vote short.</p><p>The Christian Democrats (CDA) immediately dropped their support for the bill, arguing that people should not face prison or a fine for offering humanitarian support such as a cup of soup to a starving refugee.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/asylum/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/politics/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=259473</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 14:28:16 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Gordon Darroch]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Eritrean man on trial for running major people smuggling gang</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/11/eritrean-man-on-trial-for-running-major-people-smuggling-gang/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-259474 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-court-cases category-human-rights category-society category-trafficking"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Eritrean man on trial for running major people smuggling gang</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2025-11-03T14:23:24+00:00"> November 3, 2025 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-259477" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_259477"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="665" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ANP-541113072.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ANP-541113072.jpg 1000w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ANP-541113072-560x372.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ANP-541113072-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ANP-541113072-768x511.jpg 768w" width="1000"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-259477"> ZWOLLE - Rechtbanktekening van de Eritreeër Amanuel W.
