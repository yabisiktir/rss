But the trend is leading to problems in areas such as Limburg, where Nato employees are struggling to find lodgings.</p><p>Jack van Oppen, estate agent at OPS Advies, said he saw many freelancers selling properties they had bought to rent out as their pension pot, causing knock-on effects for international workers in Brunssum. “<a href="https://jfcbs.nato.int/">Nato personnel</a> typically stay for two or three years, but you see that the sale of rental homes means they cannot find a house,” he said. “Nato is saying: there just isn’t anything.”</p><p>The Netherlands is trying to tackle an estimated housing shortage of around 400,000 homes, but new-build challenges include rising construction costs, a lack of foreign investment and matching the supply to demand.</p><p>“If you build homes for older people, with a garden, they will leave their over-large home for people who want a family house,” said Goutsmits-Gerssen. “At the end of the chain, a first-time buyer gets a home.
