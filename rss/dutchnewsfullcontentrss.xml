Failure to agree financial support would have been “a total disaster”, he said. “We would not only have abandoned Ukraine, but ourselves. Leaving Brussels divided would have cost Europe its geopolitical relevance.”</p><p data-end="2179" data-start="1959">German chancellor Friedrich Merz also welcomed the outcome, “These funds are sufficient to cover the military and budgetary needs of Ukraine for the two years to come,” Merz told new agency AP.

The website is loaded with tips for new arrivals on anything from buying a home to raising a child in the Netherlands.</p><p>Children in the Netherlands are allowed to do a limited amount of paid work from the age of 13, and to work legally from the age of 15, but they often have a bank account and a debit card before that.

That isn’t the case.”</p><p data-end="2712" data-start="2482">Immunologist Ger Rijkers said it is inevitable the British virus will reach the Netherlands. “Viruses don’t respect borders,” he said.
