That will appeal to Yesilgöz, who campaigned on a pledge to shut Klaver’s party out of the cabinet.</p><p>Opinion polls since the election have shown support for the PVV falling off sharply since the election. A Maurice de Hond survey published at the weekend, before the split was announced, found Wilders’s party would win just 17 seats.</p><p>The main beneficiary was FVD, which is predicted to double its contingent to 14 seats, while JA21 would win 11, a gain of two.
