[India being] four down at 16 [overs], they obviously had wickets in hand there and obviously, took down a few overs at the end.”</p><p>De Leede echoed his sentiments: “It’s obviously a ground with a shorter side to the one side so boundaries were definitely gettable and I fully believed that we could have chased this down.”</p><p>The Dutch team suffered from the lack of a genuine power hitter, or two, in their lower-middle order. Needing 76 off the last 30 balls, similar to what India managed, they could only manage 59.</p><h2>Off-spin in powerplay</h2><p>Against India’s left-hand dominated batting lineup, with as many as six in their top eight, Scott Edwards used the obvious matchup, bowling four overs of off-spin in the powerplay.</p><p>Dutt extended Abhishek Sharma’s run drought – the number one ranked T20I batter is yet to get off the mark after three innings – and also accounted for Ishan Kishan, India’s leading run-scorer at the tournament.</p><p>He should have added Dube to his wicket tally if not for the umpire’s call to deny him a leg before wicket.</p><p>The Dutch seamers took pace off the ball on a slow black soil pitch to keep a check on the run-rate, never allowing it to creep up beyond eight an over until the final overs.</p><h2>Openers struggled</h2><p>In response, the openers, Max O’Dowd and Michael Levitt were wary against the new ball and struggled for rhythm, eventually being dismissed two overs apart.</p><p>De Leede and Colin Ackermann stitched a crucial 43-run partnership as the duo looked to accelerate. Dutt was elevated to number 5, walking out before Edwards, in a bid to take down the Indian spinners but fell first ball to Chakravarthy, who walked away with figures of 3-14.</p><p>Several batters started well but failed to convert them into a substantial score. Zach Lion-Cachet (26 off 16) and Noah Croes (25 not out off 12), the latter on his World Cup debut, matched Edwards with a reverse lap and sweeps and kept the Dutch in the hunt briefly with a flurry of inventive boundaries, but fell short, with 28 runs needed off the last over.</p><p>The men’s squad will reconvene in April for the start of the domestic season and a preparatory camp ahead of their next Cricket World Cup League 2 games against the US and hosts Canada in May.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/cricket-2/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/sport/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=263823</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 07:37:35 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Malhar Hathi]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>International energy: Volt event begins local election drive</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/02/international-energy-volt-event-begins-local-election-drive/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-263799 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-election category-election-2026 category-politics newsletter-include"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> International energy: Volt event begins local election drive</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-02-18T15:04:57+00:00"> February 18, 2026 </time> <a class="me-2" href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/author/senay/" rel="author"> Senay Boztas </a></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-236516" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_236516"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="1512" sizes="(max-width: 2016px) 100vw, 2016px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_6386.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_6386.jpg 2016w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_6386-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_6386-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_6386-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_6386-1536x1152.jpg 1536w" width="2016"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-236516"> New elections loom.

That was one of the subjects at a <a href="https://voltnederland.org/en/amsterdam/events/your-city-your-voice">“your city, your voice” election event</a> hosted by Volt on Tuesday night.</p><p>The evening – the first of a number to target internationals who may be able to vote in local elections – gave information about local politics and asked foreign residents for their ideas.</p><p>A number of the questions and concerns were around housing, with a shortage of some 40,000 apartments in the city. “What about renting without registration?” asked one man. “I see it on certain Whatsapp groups, but it becomes quite exploitative. Is this on the municipal radar?”</p><p>“It’s not allowed – it’s illegal,” said councillor and head of the local Volt party Juliet Broersen. “But it comes back to the question: there’s a housing crisis and people need rooms. It is very frustrating. When I look at my neighbour, they have an apartment with five empty bedrooms but they are only allowed to rent out two: the city makes it very hard to have multiple households.”</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>The meeting heard stories about locks to doors being changed after a man had achieved a rent reduction at a tribunal, people paying too much but feeling unable to complain for fear of losing their house, and sometimes being unable to vote at all because they were not registered as a city resident where they lived.</p><p>Making sharing homes easier is one of the initiatives that <a href="https://amsterdam.raadsinformatie.nl/document/16429893/1/556_25+Amendement+Von+Gerhardt+Broersen+optimaal+gebruik+maken+ruimte+in+de+stad-woningdelen?connection_type=17&amp;connection_id=12801545">Volt recently put forward jointly</a>, to help young people and students – a voter group that this <a href="https://voltnederland.org/storage/amsterdam/2026/volt-amsterdam-election-programme-2026.pdf">liberal, pro-European party</a> tries to represent.

to the international community – <a href="https://www.at5.nl/artikelen/213113/volt-kan-niet-wachten-om-in-de-raad-te-komen-expats-zijn-een-verrijking-voor-de-stad">headlining an article with his quote</a> that “expats enrich the city.”</p><p>It has a foreign-born candidate, Verena Kitowski, from Germany, who has lived in Amsterdam for six years. “Volt recognises not only the internationals but all migrants – Amsterdam is a city built on people who moved here at some point in time, and Volt really embraces that,” she said.</p><p>The party supports making language courses cheaper and easier, as well as more awareness on the part of Dutch people that it is is difficult to achieve fluency if people refuse to speak Dutch to foreigners.</p><p>“The moment you start talking, people switch to English,” she said. “It’s about awareness in people fluent in Dutch that they can help their fellow Amsterdammers.”</p><h2>Get involved</h2><p>The main message was to get involved. “Every city council meeting is open, there’s a livestream, and you have the right to speak,” said Garmy. “[Many] internationals are not showing up to vote – spread the word!”</p><p><strong>A number of meetings and other events are being organised to spread the word among the Netherlands’ international population as <a

In 2017, the way this ground was valued was changed and leaseholders were given a choice to do nothing, pay off their lease or switch to a more expensive, permanent <em>eeuwigdurende</em> annual ground rent.</p><p>Now, however, the local CDA party believes that the council did not explain in a <a href="https://www.tias.edu/artikelen/grondwaardecommissie-pleit-eenvoud-amsterdamse-erfpacht">crystal clear way</a> what would happen if home owners who are liable for ground rent did nothing.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>At the end of their 50-year lease period, the council now reassesses the ground rent using a system that puts up annual payments by far more than the rise in house prices – the <a href="https://centaur.reading.ac.uk/55567/1/wp0116.pdf">discredited</a> “residual method”, <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/698cb666bb6023ea0f7123d5/Policy_statement_on_ground_rents.pdf">previously used</a> by developers in England.</p><p>“It is a complex financial product,” said CDA councillor Laurens Lochtenberg. “Most people don’t understand. This especially affects those with a lower level of education and internationals who don’t have mastery of the language. The ruling is like saying that next to your mortgage, the ground loan is €80,000…but if you don’t do anything, it will go up to €400,000.”</p><h2><strong>Unaffordable</strong></h2><p>Dutch papers have reported a case in Amsterdam where an 87-year-old leaseholder’s ground rent will go from <a href="https://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/van-315-euro-naar-35-000-euro-erfpacht-per-jaar-henk-raaff-stapte-niet-over-en-krijgt-nu-de-rekening-gepresenteerd-voelt-als-een-boete~b94aa17b/">€315 a year to €35,000</a> because he did not make the switch in time.</p><p>In Rotterdam, the head of housing Chantal Zeegers <a href="https://www.rijnmond.nl/nieuws/2101422/na-kritiek-op-hoge-erfpacht-komt-rotterdam-met-korting-voor-huiseigenaren">has announced that</a> she will lower ground rents and lease purchasing costs for around 25,000 leasehold houses because the new rates are unaffordable.

It wants the offer to be resent, signed post, in “simple and clear” English as well as in Dutch.</p><p>Lochtenberg said if he wants to invest in stocks via his bank, he has to take a course to prove that he understands the risks – but he believes that with leasehold products, Amsterdam council may have breached fair trading and compliance obligations. He has also raised questions about whether the council made <a href="https://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/amsterdamse-huizenbezitters-betaalden-mogelijk-veel-te-veel-erfpachtkosten-door-fout-dit-is-een-smoking-gun/128271778.html">mistakes in calculating ground values</a>.</p><p>Consumer protection body <a href="https://www.erfpachtinamsterdam.nl/archief/2021-11-10_Raadsinformatiebrief%20spijtoptantenregeling%20overstap.pdf">the ACM has said</a> that Amsterdam council was probably “not clear enough” in explaining that it would multiply ground values to make a much greater sum if leaseholders did not pay off their lease or move voluntarily to the new permanent rent.</p><h2>Report</h2><p>A <a href="https://openresearch.amsterdam/nl/page/75106/raadsonderzoek-erfpachtbeleid-amsterdam">report in 2022</a> found that the city did not use open data in calculating street values, so residents could not check their home’s calculations, made “arbitrary choices” in its sums and charged much higher levies than banks use to reduce “the risk that consumers can no longer pay their mortgages”. The multiplier effect was not “clearly and explicitly” communicated, it said.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>In addition, says Lochtenberg, in the group that did not switch, “[almost] <a href="https://amsterdam.raadsinformatie.nl/document/14105400/1">40% of people</a> said they did not get the letter, 40% did not understand it and 6% didn’t have the money to pay for a lawyer.”</p><p>Every year, he claims, some of them are now faced with extreme rises in ground rents, because property prices in Amsterdam have <a href="https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/cijfers/detail/83906NED">doubled in the past decade</a>. “I get letters with people saying that they cannot sleep at night,” he said.</p><p>The CDA has calculated that in the next seven years, around 10,000 leaseholders will be forced to switch to the “residual method” valuation – especially in Nieuw-West, Zuidoost and Noord.</p><h2><strong>“All Dutch”</strong></h2><p>In <a href="https://amsterdam.raadsinformatie.nl/document/14105400/1">city research from 2023</a>, one international is quoted as being totally confused. “All information is in Dutch without translation,” she said. “The first letter dates back to 2020. Even though I immediately applied, it took three years before we received another letter.</p><p>“I again immediately applied on the website, and now it is on hold until an undefined date. We have never received any estimate of what we will have to pay.”</p><p>Opposition party the VVD also disagrees with the system, because many homes that are built on their “own land” do not pay anything, and ground rents vary from hundreds of euros to thousands, depending on when leasehold property was built.</p><p>“The left of the city council wants to keep the system because it brings in a lot of money, but it’s an unfair, unbalanced system,” said Daan Wijnants, head of the local VVD.</p><p>The CDA, VVD and JA21 have proposed <a href="https://amsterdam.raadsinformatie.nl/document/16597462/1/Gemeenteraad+Voordracht?connection_type=1&amp;connection_id=10046133">new bylaws to protect consumer rights</a> in leasehold agreements, which will be discussed at a council meeting on Wednesday 18.
