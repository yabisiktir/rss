Here’s what the Dutch team are hoping to achieve.</strong></p><p>If you’ve never watched a Winter Olympics in the Netherlands before, it can feel like stepping into a two-dimensional parallel universe.</p><p>While the rest of the world is enthralled by athletes hurtling down mountainsides on skis, in bobsleighs and on the terrifying tea-trays of luge, the Dutch prefer to keep things on the level and indulge in their national obsession with speed skating.</p><p>For two and a half weeks, <a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/schedule">starting from the opening ceremony on February 6</a>, names such as Femke Kok, Jenning de Boo, Kjeld Nuis and Jutta Leerdam will fuel conversations in households, on talk shows and around water coolers.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>Beanie-hatted commentators will talk animatedly about crossovers, lane changes and whether the ice is faster after the <em>dweil</em>, when the rink is swept clear of debris halfway through the programme.</p><p>At some point someone will bring up the time four-time Olympic champion Sven Kramer missed out on a fifth gold when he was <a href="https://nos.nl/video/2596541-reconstructie-de-fatale-wissel-van-sven-kramer-in-2010">disqualified for skating in the wrong lane</a> because of a mix-up by his coach.</p><p>Seven out of 10 people in the Netherlands <a href="https://tvvisie.nl/nieuws/nederland/26februari2022/kijkcijfers-7-op-10-nederlanders-beleven-winterspelen-bij-nos_113822/">tuned in to NOS’s coverage of the last Winter Games in Beijing</a>, watching an average of nine hours each – despite a seven-hour time difference.</p><h2>Schouten treble</h2><p>The high point was Irene Schouten’s triumph in the women’s 3000m, the first of her three gold medals, when 1.7 million people cheered on the 29-year-old from their living-rooms and breakfast tables on a Saturday morning.</p><p>The Netherlands came away from Beijing with six gold medals on the ice, including three for Schouten, four silvers and two bronzes.</p><p>This year 18 of <a href="https://www.teamnl.org/artikelen/2025/12/deelnemers-nederland-olympische-winterspelen-milaan">the 39 Dutch athletes in Milan</a> will be speed skaters, with another nine hoping to win medals in the kamikaze condensed version known as short track. Suzanne Schulting, a triple Olympic champion on the short oval, will feature in both.</p><p>Die-hard skating fan Johan van Buren, who is heading to his sixth Olympics, said: “The atmosphere during a skating event is always fantastic. It’s all about performance and the fans cheer on every skater, not just those from their own country.”</p><h2>Kok hot favourite</h2><p>The Dutch squad for Milan is once again packed with gold medal contenders, but the strongest favourite is Femke Kok in the women’s sprints.</p><p>The 25-year-old from Opsterland <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2590745-kok-verpulvert-wereldrecord-500-meter-in-salt-lake-tot-36-09-hoe-kan-dit">set a new world record for 500m of 36.09 seconds in November</a>, taking a quarter of a second off a mark that had stood for 12 years, and is unbeaten in her last 23 races at the shortest distance.</p><p>Kok is also going in the 1,000 and 1,500 metres, where she will face competition from her team-mates, Jutta Leerdam and Antoinette De Jong.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>Leerdam is better known outside the Netherlands as the fiancé of YouTube personality turned boxer Jake Paul and boasts <a href="https://www.instagram.com/juttaleerdam/">a 5 million-strong Instagram following</a>, but her record on the ice is even more impressive.</p><p>She won a silver medal at 1,000m in Beijing and will be hoping to go one better as she tries to add an Olympic title to her collection of 13 world and European gold medals.</p><h2>Takagi threat</h2><p>Their biggest rival for gold is the Japanese defending champion <a href="https://www.eurosport.nl/schaatsen/milaan-cortina-2026/2026/maak-kennis-met-miho-takagi-japanse-wil-jutta-leerdam-en-femke-kok-van-goud-afhouden_vid60050438/video.shtml">Miho Takagi</a>, who began her quest for a third Olympic gold with a six-week training camp <a href="https://nos.nl/video/2590380-japanse-topschaatsster-takagi-slijpt-op-nederlands-vakantiepark-aan-olympische-vorm">on a holiday park in Noord-Holland</a>.</p><p>De Jong took bronze over 3,000m in Pyeongchang eight years ago and 1,500 in Beijing. This year she is concentrating on the shorter distance, while world champion Joy Beune missed out on a place as she could only finish fourth at the Dutch national trials.</p><p>Beune, who has won four of the five world cup rounds over her favourite distance, will be looking to make amends at the 3,000m. Marijke Groenewoud is competing in both the longer distances, but her best chance of gold is in the mass start, where she is a double world champion.</p><h2>Versatile Schulting</h2><p>Suzanne Schulting will also contest the 1,000m as she tries to become the first man or woman to win Olympic titles on the big oval and at shorttrack.</p><p>She will <a href="https://www.nu.nl/olympische-spelen/6384370/schulting-mag-olympische-shorttracktitel-op-1000-meter-niet-verdedigen-in-milaan.html">not be going for a third shorttrack gold over 1,000 metres</a>, however, after the selectors opted for the Velzenboer sisters, Xandra and Michelle, and Selma Poutsma.

Kimberley Bos, the other team flag carrier, made history in Beijing as the first Dutch medallist away from the ice rink when she won bronze in skeleton bob.</p><p>The 32-year-old from Ede will be hoping to be on the podium again in Milan, but her best World Cup result so far this year is a fourth place in Altenberg.</p><p>The Dutch are also sending a figure skating pair to the Olympics for the first time, in the shape of Michel Tsiba and Russian-born Daria Danilova, as well as two-man and four-man men’s bobsleigh teams.</p><p>Melissa Peperkamp <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2600107-o-wacht-ik-ben-mijn-board-vergeten-een-dag-met-olympisch-snowboarder-peperkamp">is the Netherlands’ best hope for a medal in the snowboarding events</a>, where she is joined by Romy van Vreden, Michelle Dekker and Glenn de Blois.</p><p>But hopes of an unlikely Dutch medal in downhill skiing were crushed when the former giant slalom champion Marcel Hirscher, who used to compete for Austria but switched allegiance to the Netherlands two years ago, <a href="https://www.nu.nl/sport-overig/6382052/skilegende-hirscher-niet-namens-nederland-naar-spelen-ben-niet-op-topniveau.html">was unable to recover from a series of injuries</a>.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/olympics/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/skating/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/sport/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=263262</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 07:20:19 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Gordon Darroch]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Greener greenery?

Professor Bas Bloem, neurologist at the Radboud University Medical Center, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/20/dutch-flower-growers-urged-stop-pesticides-neurological-disorders">believes that</a> – particularly with “luxury products” such as flowers – commonly used weed killers such as <a href="https://www.bnnvara.nl/zembla/artikelen/glyfosaat-de-pr-machine">glyphosate</a> should be banned until proven safe.</p><p>“There is 40 years of research with converging evidence from epidemiology, toxicology, animal studies, and other types of research that consistently indicates that pesticides are one of the contributing factors that may cause Parkinson’s disease,” he told Dutch News. “Pesticides are not the only cause of Parkinson’s, but there is widespread consensus that they are among the various environmental factors that jointly contribute to causing this disease.”</p><p>It is, he said, the world’s fastest-growing neurodegenerative condition. “This is not to say that the currently used pesticides are a definite cause of Parkinson’s but they have never been proven to be safe,” he said.</p><p><strong>Densely-populated</strong></p><p>According to investigative journalists from the Zembla programme Ton van der Ham and Vincent Harmsen, a million people in the densely-populated Netherlands live within 250 metres of a field.</p><p>Hans van Boven, a spokesman for the board for the government’s pesicide testing authohrity Ctgb) told Dutch News there is currently a gap in the testing. “At the moment, we judge as many aspects as possible, and when we are allowing a substance, we look at whether neurological effects are visible,” he said.</p><p>“Regarding the risk of Parkinson’s, we don’t look at this specifically. We want to do this but we need a European framework, so we have submitted a request to the European Food Safety Authority to develop one.”</p><p>He said, however, that while its stance was that all products it has tested are safe to use, local councils are free to make their own rulings. “There can be other reasons why for example a municipality or a province doesn’t want bulb growing,” he said.</p><p>“This isn’t so much about the safe use of substances but you could say – for political reasons – that you do not want any chemical pesticides to be used within 50 metres of a residential area or within 50 metres of a school playground. That’s a political judgement rather than a toxicological one. And governments can make it.”</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-251219" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_251219" style="width: 560px"><noscript><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-251219" decoding="async" height="420" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9150-560x420.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9150-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9150-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9150-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9150-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9150.jpg 2016w" width="560"/></noscript><img alt="" class="lazyload size-medium wp-image-251219" data-sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" data-src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9150-560x420.jpg" data-srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9150-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9150-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9150-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9150-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9150.jpg 2016w" decoding="async" height="420" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20560%20420%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="560"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-251219">The Hortus Bulborum in Limmen in full bloom last spring.

The Rijnland water board is <a href="https://www.bollenstreekomroep.nl/in-bollenstreek-geen-metingen-op-dinoterb-in-oppervlaktewater/">investigating</a> surface waters for banned pesticides in the so-called Bollenstreek bulb growing area, after questions at local council level <a href="https://www.lissernieuws.nl/nieuws/algemeen/92951/pesticidenmetingen-roepen-raadsvragen-op">in Lisse</a>.</p><p>Floral tourist attraction the Keukenhof – which reported €14.7 million in pre-tax profit in its 2024 accounts – is sponsoring a €100,000 Wageningen University &amp; Research study into developing virus-free and more resistant bulbs. It did not answer Dutch News’s specific questions about what pesticides it uses, and in what quantities, saying this varies according to the weather and that it reduced pesticide usage in 2024.</p><p>Spokeswoman Martine de Ridder told Dutch News that it is working to switch to organic-only crop protection products as quickly as possible. “Keukenhof uses only permitted products that meet the strictest standards,” she said in an email.</p><p>“Keukenhof holds an internationally recognised MPS-A+ certification, which means our environmental impact is kept as low as possible. During the visiting season we use biological crop-protection products.”</p><p><strong>Positive choice</strong></p><p>Creating a market for organic flower farming – and accepting that some plants might not survive all weathers – is, according to some, part of the challenge. Kingma, whose residents’ case has now gone to the Supreme Court, pointed out that most Dutch flower and bulb farming is for export but welcomed Amsterdam’s decision.</p><p>“It won’t really put a dent in the demand, but I think it is still very useful: organically-grown flowers are only a small percentage of the entire market right now and [it is good to] increase that demand because farmers are saying it’s expensive to grow flowers without pesticides,” she said.</p><p><a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/01/locals-win-right-to-know-which-pesticides-are-used-near-them/">Locals win right to know which pesticides are used near them</a></p><p><a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/02/many-cut-flower-growers-are-flouting-pesticide-regulations/">Warning about cut flower growers flouting regulations</a></p><p>Bloem said Amsterdam’s approach was “welcome” with health in mind. “This step is in line with the precautionary principle, where the health of citizens should receive absolute priority over the use of pesticides to safeguard the health of plants, flowers, or trees,” he told Dutch News.</p><p>A couple of Amsterdam’s plants and flowers may change a little, said Van der Horst; others will be grown organically in its plant nursery, run by social enterprise Pantar. This year’s <a href="https://amsterdam.raadsinformatie.nl/document/16566735/1?connection_type=17&amp;connection_id=12942492">tulip festival</a> will also be all-organic.</p><p>“I don’t think it’s my job to make big statements,” she said. “It’s my job to show that as a city we want to give a good example, to inspire others and increase awareness. And I think this is a very positive way to do it.”</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/flowers/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/health/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/politics/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/society/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=263127</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 07:13:14 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Senay Boztas]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Class is in session: a uniquely fun way to learn Dutch</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/02/class-is-in-session-a-uniquely-fun-way-to-learn-dutch/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-263074 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-dutch-language type-learning-dutch"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h5 class="text-primary"> Partner content</h5><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Class is in session: a uniquely fun way to learn Dutch</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-02-06T07:07:19+00:00"> February 6, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-263075" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_263075"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="1920" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20250808_152223-scaled.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20250808_152223-scaled.jpg 2560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20250808_152223-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20250808_152223-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20250808_152223-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20250808_152223-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20250808_152223-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" width="2560"/></figure><main class="px-4"><p><strong>In these days of online and AI learning, the Dutch Brainwash course is decidedly (and purposefully) old school. Here’s why you should take it if you want to <em>really </em>speak Dutch. </strong></p><p>Albert Both’s casual classroom on Amsterdam’s Keizersgracht, where he’s been teaching internationals how to speak Dutch since 2009 at his <a href="https://talencoach.nl/programs/brainwash/">Talencoach </a>headquarters, is about as far away from online learning as you can get. With so many AI-driven Dutch language courses available these days, Both’s schooling style – he’s part comedian, part therapist, part event planner and part language facilitator – is indeed made for live.</p><p>“If you want to transform Dutch from a boring routine or tough obligation into a fun, vibrant, entertaining pursuit, this course is for you,” says student Yulia Kachesova (57), who lives in Antwerp and had taken Dutch language classes before. “I realised something had been missing from my previous attempts: an emotional connection with the language.”</p><p>Which is provided by Both in droves – live, in class. “You’re either a live language trainer or a YouTube star,” says Both, who finds teaching online classes boring. “I want to focus on groups where people can come together and talk, which is what they also want.”</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>And talk they do. Not just idle chit chat about the weather and “survival-based Dutch like how to buy things,” but about love, life and “what to do if someone is highly annoying,” says Both. The casual conversation, amiable atmosphere and large dose of humour uniquely motivate his students.</p><p>“We can read each other’s body language and express ourselves more in person,” says American career and leadership coach Joe Mier (40), who has been living in Amsterdam for 15 years and was looking for a class that went beyond rules and grammar. “Making personal connections with Albert and your classmates, talking during breaks, having a sense of humour and making jokes – all that works better in person than online.”</p><p>Albert’s course, he says, “helped me the most with finding the fun in learning, speaking Dutch and building my confidence. It triggered my interest in reading more Dutch books, news and watching shows. I am always learning and making mistakes, but it has given me more confidence to speak Dutch and hold my own in a Dutch conversation. It felt like an extra push to get out of your comfort zone and start enjoying Dutch more.”</p><h2><strong>Mr Dutch Brainwash</strong></h2><p>Both, also known as Mr Dutch Brainwash after the one-week intensive Dutch language course he designed based on his own <a href="https://talencoach.nl/programs/brainwash/">“brainwash”</a> method, caps his courses at eight people per session.</p><p>“We sit around a table like a group of friends,” he says. “My students inspire each other to learn. We create a safe and fun atmosphere, as compared to their past traumatic experiences learning Dutch, which were often impersonal and had students sitting there like they were in a factory.”</p><p><noscript><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-263076" decoding="async" height="315" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20250520_143117-560x315.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20250520_143117-560x315.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20250520_143117-1200x676.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20250520_143117-768x432.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20250520_143117-1536x865.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20250520_143117-2048x1153.jpg 2048w" width="560"/></noscript><img alt="" class="lazyload alignnone size-medium wp-image-263076" data-sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" data-src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20250520_143117-560x315.jpg" data-srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20250520_143117-560x315.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20250520_143117-1200x676.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20250520_143117-768x432.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20250520_143117-1536x865.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20250520_143117-2048x1153.jpg 2048w" decoding="async" height="315" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20560%20315%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="560"/></p><p>Not that there isn’t value to online courses. In fact, Both says it helps when someone who has taken one then joins his course.</p><p>“It’s great when they do Duolingo and then me,” he says. “Even the nuns put you in a language lab behind a computer. But here students can put into practice what they’ve been learning with real people.”</p><h2><strong>AI versus live</strong></h2><p>“In general, being an introvert, I’m perfectly fine with online activities,” agrees Yulia, who has taken online classes. “But I believe the offline format actually amplified the course’s success.</p><p>“AI offers plenty of support for language learning, but it’s unlikely to place the language at the heart of its cultural and historical context. It can’t deliver the fun and entertainment of true language learning, nor let you experience ‘live’ or informal language in action…. Albert placed Dutch in a broader context, turning it into a logical piece of the puzzle. That’s what I loved most.”</p><p>Many of Both’s students highlight his unique approach to language and teaching that <a href="https://www.facebook.com/talencoach">drew them to his course</a> in the first place, including his insistence that Dutch is not as hard to learn as people think. “He talked about how English speakers can use certain tricks to help them speak Dutch. That caught my attention, and his logic really clicked with me. I wanted to learn the language in a smart way,” says 39-year-old student and doctor AQ.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>“I would describe the course as someone giving you a key to the door of the Dutch language,” he says. “It is then one’s responsibility to hold on to that key and learn how to use it. This means applying logic to continue learning, practicing consistently, and allowing yourself to make mistakes.”</p><p>AQ has also taken online courses before but says that in-person classes have their own “vibe and energy” compared to virtual ones. “Communication is not only about voice and video; there is also chemistry and body language, which have a more positive effect on learning—not just a language, but anything. AI is a great tool…but there were numerous instances where AI could not explain certain language concepts well or translated words in ways that did not make sense.”</p><p>Fred Paler (50), a healthcare worker from the Philippines, was also drawn to Both’s Brainwash after reading about his approach to language learning. He says it improved his Dutch and was instrumental in helping him pass his inburgering exams.</p><p>“After two sessions, as I rode the train, I could feel and understand confidently what the conductor was saying, which I believe is the effect of Albert’s class,” he says. “AI tools do not teach you the nuances of the Dutch language. Grammar wise, online courses have helped me, but as far as <em>speaking </em>Dutch is concerned, I was not that confident before Albert’s class.”</p><h2><strong>Back to class</strong></h2><p>For anyone looking for a Dutch refresher class, struggling with stalled motivation or wanting to focus on speaking the language, Both’s class is invaluable, says Yulia. “It’s perfect for open-minded, curious people eager to try something new without rigid mental barriers labelled ‘right’ or ‘wrong.’”</p><p>“The Dutch Brainwash is not a classic language course, and that is exactly why I loved it,” adds AQ. “I think it is for people who are curious, flexible and open-minded.”</p><p><em>If that sounds like you, </em><a href="https://talencoach.nl/programs/brainwash/"><em>sign up here</em></a><em> for the next Dutch Brainwash!</em></p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" href="/life-in-the-netherlands/learning-dutch/"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/dutch-language/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=263074</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 07:07:19 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Lauren Comiteau]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Discrimination complaints to human rights institute soar 30%</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/02/discrimination-complaints-to-human-rights-institute-soar-30/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-263245 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-disabilities category-discrimination category-society"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Discrimination complaints to human rights institute soar 30%</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-02-05T15:02:55+00:00"> February 5, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-253823" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_253823"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="1200" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WhatsApp-Image-2025-06-26-at-10.32.09.jpeg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WhatsApp-Image-2025-06-26-at-10.32.09.jpeg 1600w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WhatsApp-Image-2025-06-26-at-10.32.09-560x420.jpeg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WhatsApp-Image-2025-06-26-at-10.32.09-1200x900.jpeg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WhatsApp-Image-2025-06-26-at-10.32.09-768x576.jpeg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WhatsApp-Image-2025-06-26-at-10.32.09-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w" width="1600"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-253823"> Campaign posters at an anti-racism conference.
