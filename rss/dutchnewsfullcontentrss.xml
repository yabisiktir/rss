In the previous survey, just 37% agreed not to rent to foreigners. In 22% of cases, agents refused to cooperate, and a similar proportion pointed out that it would be illegal to discriminate but that it would be up to the landlord themselves.</p><p data-end="1022" data-start="668"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1235" data-start="1024">“This is a difficult area for landlords because of the economic argument,” lead researcher Marcel Coenders told Dutch News. “They may be willing [to discriminate] because they want to get the client on board.” The amount of rental housing that falls outside the rent-controlled sector in the Netherlands is shrinking, and competition for properties is fierce.</p><p data-end="1235" data-start="1024">At the same time, several landlords told the researchers that they should welcome “expat tenants” because they had high salaries and would leave after a few years, Coenders said.</p><p data-end="1616" data-start="1390">Members of one of the various professional organisations for letting agents and estate agents were less likely to agree to discriminate, but nevertheless, 42% were still willing to do so. Just under 30% refused to cooperate.</p><p data-end="1768" data-start="1618">The NVM estate agents organisation told Dutch News that it condemns discrimination in the housing market and has been working hard to counteract it.</p><p data-end="1768" data-start="1618"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="2142" data-start="1770">“Efforts to tackle housing discrimination would get a major boost if a legal quality standard for real estate agents were introduced,” the organisation said. “This would make it possible to ban agents who deliberately discriminate from continuing to operate in the market. After all, members expelled from NVM can currently still continue their practices independently.”</p><p data-end="2376" data-start="2144">The researchers also followed up on adverts posted on the Pararius housing website, posing as singletons, part of a couple, or part of a gay couple to find out if people with Turkish, Moroccan or Polish names faced discrimination.</p><p data-end="2682" data-start="2378">In total, the researchers responded 3,800 times to rental housing adverts. For the first time, the researchers found little difference in the reactions from agencies and landlords between the different types of potential tenants, and those differences that did exist were “statistically insignificant.”</p><p data-end="2682" data-start="2378"><em>Have you faced discrimination when trying to rent property in the Netherlands?

times the number in 2023, according to figures shared with <a href="https://www.nu.nl/binnenland/6377035/dit-jaar-al-500-nepagenten-aangehouden-en-ruim-10000-incidenten-geregistreerd.html">news website Nu.nl</a>. Over 10,000 incidents involving fake officers have been registered so far in 2025.</p><p data-end="610" data-start="319">The phenomenon was rare until 2023 but there has since been a sharp increase in both reported incidents and arrests, Nu.nl said. This year’s arrests involve people who turned up at victims’ homes as well as those working from call centres. In 2024 there were 357 arrests, compared with just 127 in 2023.</p><p data-end="801" data-start="612">Police say the high number of arrests reflects the “exponential rise” in cases but also targeted investigations.</p><p data-end="1148" data-start="803">The criminals almost always follow the same pattern. They call victims to say there has been a spate of break-ins in the area and offer to collect valuables to keep them “safe”. The aim is to keep the time between the call and the home visit as short as possible so victims do not have the chance to seek advice or reconsider handing over items.</p><p data-end="1148" data-start="803"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1318" data-start="1150">Police spokeswoman Suzanne van de Graaf told Nu.nl the criminals operate in groups. Once someone calls from a call centre, an accomplice quickly arrives at the victim’s door.</p><p data-end="1546" data-start="1320">Police have recorded 10,631 incidents so far this year, including both successful and attempted thefts. That is 20 times the number in 2023, when just 520 cases were logged.</p><p data-end="1791" data-start="1548">Van de Graaf said the rise appears to be driven by copycat behaviour and that there is not one large network behind the cases. The increase may also reflect greater public awareness and reporting, she said.</p><p data-end="1791" data-start="1548"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="2290" data-start="2083">Meanwhile, a pro forma court hearing will take place on Wednesday in the case of an 80-year-old woman who died in Amsterdam after being robbed by a fake officer in August.
