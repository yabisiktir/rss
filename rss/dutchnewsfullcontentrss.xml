Some 2,900 people were granted asylum on that basis last year, down 7,000 on a year earlier.</p><p data-end="616" data-start="316"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="846" data-start="618">The main reason for the fall in successful asylum applications was a change in the official approach to Syria. At the end of 2024, the Netherlands stopped processing claims from Syrian asylum seekers following the regime change.</p><p data-end="1006" data-start="848">In total, just 390 claims by Syrians were assessed in 2025, and 28% were approved.

The building is located in a green neighbourhood that is still being developed, and the apartments offer great views over a large part of the city. With the Noord-Zuid metro line just around the corner, you can be in the city centre in seven minutes and the Zuidas central business district in just fifteen.</p><p data-end="1231" data-start="835">“Noord is really up and coming, with loads of restaurants, bars and cultural activities,” says Tom Brinkman, the man to go to about moving to the Singelblok development.</p><p data-end="1231" data-start="835">“There is a bit of a pioneering spirit here, but at the same time you are so close to the rest of the city.
