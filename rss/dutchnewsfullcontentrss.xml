Trump later spoke of a possible “framework” for a deal after talks with Rutte and abandoned extra tariffs, a shift that international media attributed in part to the Nato chief’s behind-the-scenes diplomacy.</p><p data-end="1525" data-start="1164"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1205" data-start="843">Rutte said the underlying issue was not sovereignty over Greenland, but the collective security of the Arctic. The region, he told the paper, has been a strategic concern for Washington for years, given Russian military activity and growing Chinese ambitions.</p><p data-end="1205" data-start="843">“The security of the Arctic as a Nato responsibility is highly relevant,” he said.</p><p data-end="1433" data-start="1207">Rutte declined to comment publicly on sensitivities in Denmark and Greenland, saying disputes between allies are best handled privately. “As soon as I start saying what I think about the issues between allies, my ability to solve things disappears,” he said.</p><p data-end="1749" data-start="1435">Rutte also reiterated his call for Nato countries to move towards spending 5% of GDP on defence. Europe, he said, must accelerate arms production, support defence start-ups drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine and convert parts of existing industry to military use.</p></div><div class="markdown prose dark:prose-invert w-full wrap-break-word light markdown-new-styling"><p data-end="1749" data-start="1435"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="2048" data-start="1751">He also dismissed the idea that Europe could soon replace US military power. Even with Britain and France as nuclear states, he said, they are “small” compared with the arsenals of the US and Russia. Without America, Europe would need to spend as much as 8% or 9% of GDP on defence, he said.</p><p data-end="3067" data-start="2873">Despite criticism of his diplomatic style, Rutte said he remains focused on results rather than approval. “I don’t need to win a popularity prize,” he said. “I get energy from solving problems.”</p><p data-end="2784" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="" data-start="2590">“I will continue to focus on the job and who I am,” he said. “This summer there was a lot of fuss about the<a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/06/nato-summit-successes-a-bromance-trumps-height-and-pickles/"> ‘daddy’ comment</a> and that text message from Trump.
