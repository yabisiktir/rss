Feasibility studies, permit procedures and lengthy political negotiations can take years, while protests at proposed locations have flared repeatedly, the paper said.</p><p data-end="903" data-start="377">The result is a backlog of stalled plans from Zeeland to Groningen, with delays in places including Houten, Zaltbommel, Venray, Terneuzen, Aalten, Haaksbergen, Amersfoort, Montferland, Neder-Betuwe, the Hogeland, Bladel and Geldermalsen.</p><p data-end="903" data-start="377"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1262" data-start="905">Ridderkerk, which has been looking at setting up a 250-bed centre said the issue is “socially sensitive” and has paused the process until after the vote. Amersfoort has also stepped back following protests and will first spend months talking to residents, working from a list of 70 possible sites. A final decision is expected only after the elections.</p><p data-end="1441" data-start="1264">The strategy means shifts in council majorities could influence whether proposed centres open or not, and the issue is likely to become central in many local campaigns. The Netherlands will elect 340 new local councils on March 18.</p><p data-end="1995" data-start="1618">Councils that have paused their plans often point to uncertainty from The Hague. Although the outgoing cabinet promised to scrap law to spread refugees around the country, this never happened, and it remains unclear how the rules will be enforced for councils that refuse to provide accommodation.</p><p data-end="1995" data-start="1618"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1995" data-start="1618">Most local authorities support the law, but many have faced violent protests.

D66 says the law would be unworkable, while the CDA still has “many questions”.

These neighbours said immediately: ‘a family from China lives there, and maybe once every three years, they enjoy their summer holiday here’.”</p><p>She said that – in her view – homes are for city dwellers and for living in. “If you want to stay here for a short period of time, that’s what hotels are for. Houses are for Amsterdammers and everyone who wants to come to our city and is looking for a home,” she said.</p><p>Christian democratic councillor Rogier Havelaar <a href="https://amsterdam.raadsinformatie.nl/document/16230541/1/09012f9781903f9d?connection_type=1&amp;connection_id=9801415">says</a> that it would be <a href="https://x.com/RogierHavelaar/status/1993588580195660021">more efficient to ban</a> the sale of houses worth less than €623,000 as a second home.

To me, it was perfectly ordinary: a village with plenty of traditions and a cemetery full of white crosses, where we would sometimes go to lay flowers.</p><p>My grandad, Huub, would sit me in the back of his red Fiat Punto and we would drive to the American cemetery in Margraten to bring flowers to the grave of a man called Hubert. That was all I knew. It was just something we did—part of my life in Margraten. I didn’t understand why Memorial Day was so important or why so many people came to honour the men and women who lay in that field near my home.</p><p>When I started primary school, I began to sense that there was more to it. My school was named Maurice Rose primary school, after an American army major general buried there. On the Friday before Memorial Day, our school would visit the cemetery to stand by major general Maurice Rose’s grave, which the school had adopted. He is the highest-ranking American soldier buried in Margraten.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>Bit by bit, I began to piece it together: this cemetery was not just a quiet field of graves, but a monument to freedom—and our village played a special role in keeping that memory alive through the adoption of these soldiers’ graves.</p><h2>Uncovering the past</h2><p>At secondary school, my interest in history began to grow. I started to understand the stories behind those white crosses: the liberation of South-Limburg, about the young soldiers who died far from home, and about the people of Margraten who saw the cemetery being built.</p><p>My grandfather was one of them. When he was first interviewed about that period, I wasn’t allowed to watch. My parents thought the story was too intense for a 12-year-old. But that interview marked a turning point. It was the first time my grandfather spoke openly about what he witnessed.</p><p>He was only 14 years old when the war ended, and his family owned one of the pieces of land on which the American cemetery was built. He was actually the first person to see the Americans arrive and begin the construction — he was on his way to milk the family’s cow. He watched the first graves being dug and saw the bodies of American soldiers lying on the ground.</p><p>In the 1980s, my grandparents took over the adoption of a soldier’s grave: Hubert T. Bauman II from Lansing in Michigan. My mum looks after it today as grandad is 94 years old. Over the years, the pieces of the puzzle began to fit together. I started to realise that the name “Hubert” on that grave was not just a name. It stood for a person, a family, a life.</p><h2>Finding Thane’s family</h2><p>After finishing high school, I left Margraten to study elsewhere, though I regularly visited my family. Now I was driving grandad to the cemetery instead of the other way around. Then, in 2018, when I was 21, something very special happened. My mother managed to contact the family of Hubert, known to his relatives as Uncle Thane. That connection changed everything.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>In October that year, my parents and I travelled to the United States. We met John Belen, Thane’s nephew, who was in Dallas for work. From that moment on, the adoption of Thane’s grave took on a whole new meaning. He became real to me. I wanted to know who he had been, what kind of man he was, and how his life had ended in the fight for our freedom.</p><p>I read and watched accounts and stories about his unit, which my dad had discovered in books about World War II. The following May, in 2019, a group of his nieces and nephews from Michigan came to the Netherlands for Memorial Day. Together we visited the cemetery and they got to meet my grandparents and we travelled to the place where Thane was killed, in the German village of Kirchberg.</p><p>Those days left a lasting impression on me—and filled our family with a deep sense of gratitude. The bond between our families has only grown stronger. We keep in touch, we celebrate milestones, we recently mourned the loss of my grandma together. And every year we remember their uncle Thane together when they visit.</p><h2>A living act of remembrance</h2><p>I’ve come to understand that my family, and so many others in Margraten, are part of something truly unique: a living act of remembrance, of supreme gratitude, that connects generations and continents.</p><p>Today is November 27, the same day 81 years ago that our soldier, Hubert Thane Bauman II, was killed. But today is also Thanksgiving Day in the US. Thanksgiving is a day to give thanks for the people that shape your life and today we will go to the cemetery in Margraten with fresh flowers and remember Thane.</p><p>That feeling of gratitude feels even stronger. I am thankful, not only for the freedom he helped secure for me and my family, but for the unexpected gifts that his sacrifice continues to bring: friendships, family ties across the ocean, and a deeper understanding of what it means to remember.</p><h2>Documentary film</h2><p>The story of the adopters of Margraten isn’t as widely known as it should be, but <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/meandmefilm/adopters-a-feature-documentary">the documentary film </a>we are working on will tell the full story of our adoption and so many others. Every adopter takes their task to remember <em>their</em> soldier very seriously and current events show us how important it is for our community to keep doing what we have been doing for 80 years: honouring, remembering and being grateful.</p><p>This documentary has made me think back to that little girl in the back of grandad’s red Fiat Punto and realise it was the start of something special.

Mauro Junior skipped around Salah on the halfway line and served up an exquisite through-ball for Guus Til that the makeshift striker dispatched with the outside of his right boot.</p><h2>Pepi returns</h2><p>Bosz brought on Ricardo Pepi, who injured himself scoring the winner when these two teams met in Eindhoven in January, and Driouech to keep up the pressure on Liverpool’s defence.</p><p>And the move reaped dividends in the 73rd minute when Pepi cut inside from the left, held off two defenders and struck a shot that hit the base of the post before bouncing out to Driouech, who steered the ball into the corner.</p><p>As Liverpool fans began streaming out of the stadium Driouech supplied the coup de grace. Saibari and Dest combined on the right before the latter picked out the striker unmarked on the edge of the area and he curled a low shot past Mamardashvili’s right hand.</p><p>The result moves PSV up to 14th place in the Champions League table, with their next match a home fixture against Atletico Madrid on December 9.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4

van der Horst said on Wednesday that the national government is taking too long to draw up policy to tackle the nuisance caused by fatbikes and that “now is the time to look at <a

data-end="553" data-start="369">The government does plan to require children up to the age of 14 to wear a helmet when using an electric bike, including a fatbike, from 2027 but this does not go far enough, Van der Horst said.</p><p data-end="553" data-start="369"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex

out on the roads and are urging me to ban fatbikes,” she said. “I feel it is my duty to try everything in my power to tackle this problem.”</p><p data-end="758" data-start="555">Officials can draw up a local bylaw to ban fatbikes from some areas on the basis of reports about traffic safety and nuisance.</p><p data-end="1044" data-start="760">The government claims it is impossible to differentiate between a normal e-bike and a fatbike but Van der Hoorst said she would welcome a legal battle on the definition.</p><p data-end="1044" data-start="760"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4

data-end="1044" data-start="760">“Everyone knows a fatbike is very different to an e-bike,” she said. “The tyres are wider, the bikes are heavier and you don’t need to pedal to move forward, so they are more like a moped than a bike.”</p><p data-end="1282" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="" data-start="1046">Last summer Enschede council voted in favour of banning fatbikes in the city centre, and <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/09/big-dutch-cities-call-for-powers-to-ban-e-scooters-fatbikes/">other local councils</a> have said they plan to draw up their own rules to keep
