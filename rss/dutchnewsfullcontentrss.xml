Photo: DutchNews.nl</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><p><strong>Money may make the world go round but any newcomer to the Netherlands first has to get to grips with the local approach to cash and cards. Here’s a quick guide to the main Dutch financial foibles.  </strong></p><p><strong>Pin cards</strong><br/> In the Netherlands, your debit card is known as a <em>pin</em> card – because you use it with a PIN number. But even the <em>pinpas</em> is falling out of favour. More and more people now pay directly with their phones, and you can do this almost everywhere – even on public transport.</p><p><strong>Cash money</strong><br/> Cash is no longer king in the Netherlands and some shops and bars no longer accept cash at all. In fact cards overtook cash payments way back in 2017, and now only about 20% of all transactions are made with euro notes and coins.</p><p><strong>Credit cards</strong><br/> This often surprises newcomers: most supermarkets in the Netherlands don’t accept credit cards – and never have. Try paying with one at your local AH, and you’ll probably be directed to the nearest ATM instead.</p><p>Credit cards are mainly used for online purchases – especially when buying from abroad – and for travel. With a <a href="https://www.abnamro.nl/en/personal/payments/creditcards/index.html?utm_id=cp2767152551&amp;utm_campaign=cde-expats-dutchnews&amp;url_id=tid6653546226&amp;business_line=cde&amp;utm_marketing_tactic=see&amp;cc_product=no-cc&amp;media_type=display-ads&amp;po_number=0000000000&amp;publisher_channel=direct-deal&amp;campaign_type=continu">Dutch credit card,</a> your entire balance is automatically deducted from your current account each month, so you can’t rack up large debts.</p><p><strong>An ABN AMRO ATM?</strong><br/> You won’t find ATMs with ABN AMRO branding anymore. The big Dutch banks have teamed up to operate bright yellow <em>Geldmaat</em> cash machines, which are hard to miss. If you have a Dutch bank account, you won’t be charged for using them. Avoid ATMs in souvenir shops or tourist areas – they often come with extra fees.</p><p><strong>Tikkie</strong><br/> <em>Tikkie</em> is a Dutch invention ABN AMRO that lets you split café bills, chip in for group presents, or send donations with a few taps. The <em>Tikkie</em> quickly became a cultural phenomenon – everyone in the Netherlands has a story about the €2 <em>Tikkie</em> they got for their share of a chocolate bar.</p><p><strong>iDEAL</strong><br/> <em>iDEAL</em> is the Dutch online payment system that appears whenever you buy something from a Dutch webshop. It’s fast, secure and doesn’t require you to register or download anything – truly ideal in fact. From next year, though, <em>iDEAL</em> will slowly be replaced by <em>Wero</em>, a new European instant payment system designed to make cross-border payments within the EU easier.</p><p><strong>BSN to bank?</strong><br/> No BSN number yet? Don’t panic. You can still open an ABN Amro account without one – you’ll just need to provide your BSN within 90 days. That should be more than enough time, even for the slowest bureaucracy to catch up.</p><p><strong>Smart students</strong><br/> International students are often amazed by how digital the Netherlands is, especially if they come from countries where cash still rules. It’s worth setting up a bank account before you arrive so you can hop on a tram and pay for your ticket with your phone the moment you land.</p><p><a href="https://www.abnamro.nl/en/personal/payments/open-an-account/student-package/index.html?utm_id=cp2767152551&amp;utm_campaign=cde-expats-dutchnews&amp;url_id=tid2633701271&amp;business_line=cde&amp;utm_marketing_tactic=see&amp;cc_product=no-cc&amp;media_type=display-ads&amp;po_number=0000000000&amp;publisher_channel=direct-deal&amp;campaign_type=continu">ABN Amro’s international student package</a> includes everything you need to start banking, and it’s completely free – although there are small fees for foreign currency transactions.</p><p><strong>Debts and credit</strong><br/> Perhaps the best insight into the Dutch attitude to money is the word <em>schuld</em> – which means both “debt” and “guilt”.</p><p>If you have a stable income and pay your bills on time, you’re considered creditworthy. There’s no such thing as a “credit score” in the Dutch system. But miss your payments, and you’ll be listed with the Dutch Credit Registration Office (BKR). That record can stop you getting a mortgage, a phone contract or a personal loan – and yes, lenders really do check.</p><p><strong>Banking apps</strong><br/> Banking apps such as ABN Amro’s make it easy to check your balance, transfer money instantly and manage your finances 24/7. But if you prefer real contact, expat customers can still speak to someone in English over the phone – or even drop by a branch for a face-to-face chat.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/abn-amro/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=259762</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 15:30:31 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Bag of destroyed Korans and dead bird left at door of mosque</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/11/bag-of-destroyed-korans-and-dead-bird-left-at-door-of-mosque/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-259771 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-discrimination category-islam category-racism category-religion category-society newsletter-include"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Bag of destroyed Korans and dead bird left at door of mosque</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2025-11-10T13:25:10+00:00"> November 10, 2025 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-259778" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_259778"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="360" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/korans.jpg" width="480"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-259778"> Photo: Yunus Emre mosque, Emmeloord</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><p>A mosque in Flevoland has been targeted by racists who left a bag of shredded Korans on the doorstep.</p><p>The bag was found on Sunday morning outside the Yunus Esme Mosque, one of two in Emmeloord.
