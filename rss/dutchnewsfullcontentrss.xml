AvroTros, together with broadcasters from Ireland, Iceland, Spain and Slovenia, had argued that Israel’s public broadcaster should be barred because of the war in Gaza.</p><p data-end="880" data-start="441"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="880" data-start="441">AvroTros also said the Israeli government had used the contest as a “political instrument”, pointing to a government-run promotional campaign for the country’s entry.</p><p data-end="880" data-start="441">Israel conducted online campaigns in several countries encouraging people to vote for its entry, which came second last year. In the Netherlands, social media posts by the Israeli embassy featured singer Yuval Raphael speaking in Dutch and urging people to vote for her. The advert also reminded people they could vote 20 times.</p><p data-end="880" data-start="441">“The severe humanitarian suffering in Gaza, the restrictions on press freedom, and the political interference surrounding the most recent edition of the Eurovision Song Contest were incompatible with the values we stand for,” the broadcaster said in a <a href="https://www.avrotros.nl/article/avrotros-neemt-in-2026-niet-deel-aan-het-eurovisie-songfestival~1314/">statement.</a></p><p data-end="880" data-start="441"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1242" data-start="882">Spain’s public broadcaster RTVE has also confirmed it will withdraw next year.

What has happened over the past year has pushed us to our limits. Universal values such as humanity and a free press have been seriously violated and are non-negotiable for us.”</p><p data-end="1926" data-start="1592">The meeting in Geneva took place under considerable pressure, with several EBU members firmly opposed to a boycott, including Germany and Austria. Austria, which will host next year’s contest in Vienna, argued that given its own wartime history it was unthinkable to exclude Israel. Germany, too, opposed a boycott for similar reasons.</p><p data-end="1926" data-start="1592">EBU members voted in a <a href="https://www.ebu.ch/news/2025/12/ebu-members-show-clear-support-for-eurovision-reforms">secret ballot</a> about Israel’s continued participation.
