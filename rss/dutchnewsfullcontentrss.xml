They said disrupted nights damage cognitive functioning and cause other problems such as heart disease.</p><p>The position paper, reported in the Volkskrant, argues that night flights have already been reduced by 30% and that the industry has taken steps to cut noise by introducing quieter aircraft and encouraging people to take the train for shorter journeys.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>The last cabinet had pledged to cut the maximum number of flights per year from 500,000 to 478,000, but the <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/04/council-of-state-demands-clarity-on-schiphol-flight-cuts/">Council of State said</a> it had not properly explained how this would benefit local residents.</p><p>The industry players may be hoping to exploit differences between the parties negotiating to form the next coalition government on whether night flying should be further curtailed.</p><h2>Coalition differences</h2><p>The progressive-liberal D66 says noise pollution around Schiphol needs to be taken seriously, while the Christian Democrats have called for a balanced approach to meet the needs of industry, the environment and residents. But the pro-business VVD wants to stimulate the aviation sector and is opposed to banning night flights.</p><p>A spokesman for Schiphol acknowledged that the airport has changed its stance on night flying, partly because any changes to the cabinet’s aviation policy would have to be approved by the European Commission.</p><p>“That would lead to long-term uncertainty, which we view as undesirable and risky,” the spokesman said.</p><p>Brussels requires member states to consider all options to reduce noise pollution and only introduce restrictions on flights as a last resort.</p><p>The spokesman said the change of policy was “not a secret” for the airport’s shareholders. But Amsterdam city council, which owns 20% of the shares, said it was surprised by the news when approached by the Volkskrant.</p><p>Hester van Buren, the city’s alderman responsible for aviation, said: “I’m constantly being told: ‘We’re not talking about whether or not we introduce a night flying ban. So it’s a surprise to me that Schiphol is now lobbying against night closures.”</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/aviation/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/economy/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/politics/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/schiphol-2/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=262134</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 10:12:03 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Gordon Darroch]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Rijksmuseum receives mega donation for sculpture garden</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/01/rijksmuseum-receives-mega-donation-for-sculpture-garden/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-262129 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-art-and-culture category-business"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Rijksmuseum receives mega donation for sculpture garden</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-01-13T09:30:36+00:00"> January 13, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-262137" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_262137"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="717" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/3695_DQF_Rijksmuseum_Pavillion_02_DC02_Spider_CLOSEUP-e1768296592470.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/3695_DQF_Rijksmuseum_Pavillion_02_DC02_Spider_CLOSEUP-e1768296592470.jpg 1000w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/3695_DQF_Rijksmuseum_Pavillion_02_DC02_Spider_CLOSEUP-e1768296592470-560x402.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/3695_DQF_Rijksmuseum_Pavillion_02_DC02_Spider_CLOSEUP-e1768296592470-768x551.jpg 768w" width="1000"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-262137"> An artist's impression of the new sculpture garden.

said.</p><p>Vluchtelingenwerk currently offers support to refugees in preparing for the asylum procedure at 350 locations, but the cutback of €13 million, or a third of the budget, means that will have to be scaled down to 70, chairman Frank Candel <a href="https://www.vluchtelingenwerk.nl/nieuws-en-kennis/artikelen/een-pijnlijk-verlies-ons-vertrek-uit-de-opvang">said</a>.</p><p>This, he said, will lead to more unjustified rejections and subsequent court cases, because refugees will not know how to prepare for the procedure properly.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light

put pressure not only on the refugees who will lose access to information but on other organisations such as immigration service IND and COA settlement agency.</p><p>Refugees who are often caught up in lengthy procedures will also be deprived of someone to talk to and the services of an interpreter, which, Candel said, will increase the already tense situations at many residential centres.</p><p>Candel said that Vluchtelingenwerk would try to help refugees via digital consultation sessions and their remaining physical network.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden
