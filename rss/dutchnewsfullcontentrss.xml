their second win since Fred Grim took over as interim coach, beating Fortuna Sittard 3-1 in a match that both teams finished with 10 men.</p><p>Ajax went behind in the fourth minute when Kaj Sierhuis

dismissed for a lunging tackle on Rayane Bounida, but Ajax also saw red when Youri Baas was booked for the second time, meaning he will miss next week’s Klassieker against

But Elon Musk changed the policy after acquiring the company, in 2022, issuing checkmarks to premium subscribers.</p><p>Another issue raised by the commission is the lack of “critical information” in the X ad repository, including the content and topic of the advertisement and the entity paying for it, which are required under EU rules to ensure transparency, especially in political campaigns.</p><p>The Commission also said x fails to provide access to the platform’s public data for researchers, “effectively undermining research into several systemic risks in the European Union.”</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>The fine is the first penalty imposed by the commission over breaches of the EU Digital Services Act (DSA). The regulation was adopted in 2022 to establish transparency obligations in order to address the spread of disinformation, illegal content and misleading practices on large online platforms.</p><p>It also sought to harmonise a growing body of different national laws in this area. The rules apply to social networks, online marketplaces, content sharing platforms, app stores, and online travel and accommodation platforms.</p><p>Tech, sovereignty, security and democracy commissioner Henna Virkkunen said on Friday that the DSA is restoring trust in the online environment. “With the DSA’s first non-compliance decision, we are holding X responsible for undermining users’ rights and evading accountability,” she said.</p><h2>Sixty days</h2><p>X now has now 60 working days to inform the commission of how it intends to comply with EU rules regarding the use of blue checkmarks, and 90 days regarding the advertising repository and researchers’ access to public data.</p><p>Failure to take action may lead to further penalties. Under the DSA fines can be up to 6% of a company’s global annual turnover.</p><p>The commission decision is further straining relationships with the US. In reaction to the announcement, US secretary of state Marco Rubio said on the social media channel that the “European Commission’s $140 million fine isn’t just an attack on X, it’s an attack on all American tech platforms and the American people by foreign governments. The days of censoring Americans online are over.”</p><h2>Wilders</h2><p>European far-right figures also criticised the commission decision. Dutch far right leader Geert Wilders posted on Saturday: “Nobody elected you. You represent no one. You are a totalitarian institution and can’t event spell the words freedom of speech. We should not accept the fining of X, but abolish the EU commission.”</p><p><a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/01/nearly-500000-people-quit-x-in-the-netherlands-last-year/">Last year</a>, some 500,000 people and several media organisations in the Netherlands left X over concerns about the spread of hate speech and disinformation.

He acknowledged, however, that significant obstacles to forming a cabinet remain and said the party leaders carry a “major responsibility” to find a way forward.</p><p data-end="947" data-start="748">“These five parties will have to make it work. The movement must come from them,” he said. Buma is due to deliver his final report to parliament on Tuesday, ahead of a debate scheduled for Wednesday.</p><p data-end="947" data-start="748"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1102" data-start="949">Buma called the meeting for Friday morning after concluding on Thursday that there is currently <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/12/dutch-cabinet-talks-reach-impasse-with-no-coalition-possible/">no workable majority</a> or minority coalition in the offing.</p><p data-end="1267" data-start="1104">Several parties see enough common ground in the interim policy document drafted by D66 and CDA to continue talks, he said, but the key question now is “with whom”.</p><p data-end="1438" data-start="1269">D66 leader and potential prime minister Rob Jetten said Friday’s talks took place “in a pleasant atmosphere” and gave all sides “plenty to think about” over the weekend.</p><p data-end="1438" data-start="1269"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1672" data-start="1440">VVD leader Dilan Yesilgöz, who has repeatedly said she will not join a coalition with the left-wing alliance GroenLinks-PvdA, said after Friday’s meeting that “more variations are possible”, without naming any specific combinations.</p><p data-end="1892" data-start="1674">GL-PvdA leader Klaver will also continue talks in the coming days.
