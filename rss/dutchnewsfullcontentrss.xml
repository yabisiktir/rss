So I made the decision to move back to the Netherlands and I’m looking forward to the next couple of years.”</p><p>The Dutch will travel to Chennai tomorrow (Feb 11) for their next game against the USA on Friday at 14:30 CEST.

It also wants a national screening for type 2 diabetes. “We want the government to invest more in early diagnosis and prevention and promote healthy living, which will prevent many cases of type 2 diabetes,” Halbertsma said.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/health/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/healthcare/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/society/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=263391</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 08:35:45 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Hanneke Sanou]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Katwijk’s “friendly” waste bins fail to stop firework frenzy</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/02/katwijks-friendly-waste-bins-fail-to-stop-firework-frenzy/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-263397 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-fireworks category-local-government category-new-year"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Katwijk’s “friendly” waste bins fail to stop firework frenzy</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-02-10T08:31:05+00:00"> February 10, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-207794" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_207794"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="667" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Depositphotos_497426438_S.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Depositphotos_497426438_S.jpg 1000w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Depositphotos_497426438_S-560x374.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Depositphotos_497426438_S-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Depositphotos_497426438_S-768x512.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Depositphotos_497426438_S-640x427.jpg 640w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Depositphotos_497426438_S-92x62.jpg 92w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Depositphotos_497426438_S-130x87.jpg 130w" width="1000"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-207794"> Photo: Depositphotos.com</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><p data-end="191" data-start="0">Efforts by the seaside town of Katwijk to stop youngsters blowing up waste bins with fireworks during the New Year celebrations were a total failure, with more bins than ever being destroyed.</p><p data-end="352" data-start="193">The council spent some €15,000 on a campaign to give its <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/12/katwijk-urges-locals-to-blow-up-balloons-not-bins-at-new-year/">waste bins a personality</a>, with stickers and videos, and on sending locals balloons to blow up instead.</p><p data-end="539" data-start="354">However, the council <a href="https://www.rtvkatwijk.nl/ruim-50-000-euro-aan-vuurwerkschade-tijdens-jaarwisseling-in-gemeente-katwijk/">has now admitted,</a> in response to questions from local party KiesKatwijk, that the resort suffered the most New Year-related damage in five years, totalling €53,039.</p><p data-end="539" data-start="354"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="737" data-start="541">In total, 49 bins, which had been given names such as Pieter Prullenbak, were wrecked by fireworks, compared with 43 in 2025.

Luckily, that’s enough of a connection for us to review it. </strong></p><p dir="ltr">The novel opens with the adult Theo Decker, hiding, alone in a hotel room in Amsterdam. The events leading to his arrival in the Dutch capital date to a decade earlier. En route to a school meeting with his mother, which then 13-year-old Theo believes will result in his suspension, the pair visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art to view his mother’s favorite painting, the Dutch Golden Age masterpiece The Goldfinch (Het Puttertje).</p><p dir="ltr">While in the museum, Theo spots a beautiful redheaded girl with whom he becomes instantly enamored. As they are leaving, his mother spontaneously decides to return to see The Goldfinch again and Theo heads off, ostensibly to the giftshop, but really to follow his new found love interest.</p><p dir="ltr">That decision will prove fateful. A bomb goes off in the gallery, killing a number of visitors, including his mother. Theo survives, and in the aftermath, grabs The Goldfinch from the floor. The rest of the novel will revolve around him keeping his theft a secret, and keeping the priceless artwork safe.</p><p dir="ltr"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p dir="ltr">One of Tartt’s many strengths as an author is her ability to write a coming of age story that feels like an adult novel. Theo spends the book feeling the vivid and valid emotions of a teenager and young adult, but the work isn’t melodramatic or frustrating.</p><p dir="ltr">Part of the reason the work doesn’t feel childish is that much of it is told by the adult Theo reflecting back on his life. The reader discovers that Theo may not be a wholly reliable narrator. He doesn’t seem to be intentionally lying to us, rather Tartt sets the reader and Theo up. Through Theo we see one version of events, but through the people around him, we see another side.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike many novels set in the Netherlands by non-Dutch authors, Tartt gets the Dutch stuff right. Amsterdam feels like Amsterdam, not a stereotyped veneer of Amsterdam. She does take liberty with the set up, though. The Goldfinch has never hung at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, its home is in the Mauritshuis in The Hague.</p><p dir="ltr"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p dir="ltr">Coincidentally, when The Goldfinch was published, the Mauritshuis was undergoing a major, two-year renovation. Many of its famous works were part of a traveling exhibition, Vermeer, Rembrandt, and Hals: Masterpieces of Dutch Painting.</p><p dir="ltr">The Goldfinch (the book) and The Goldfinch (the painting) debuted on the same day. At every other stop of the tour, Johannes Vermeer’s Girl with a Pearl Earring was top billing. But the October 22nd opening at New York’s Frick Collection welcomed Tartt fans – it was the author’s first book in a decade – in droves.</p><p dir="ltr">“With The Goldfinch’s help, the exhibition has become the best attended in Frick history.” the museum said in a press release at the time. Neither the museum or the publisher were aware the other’s avian event was taking place.</p><p dir="ltr">Tartt’s first book, The Secret History, was a run away best seller. The Goldfinch won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and was turned into a film starring Ansel Elgort.</p><p dir="ltr">At 771 pages, the Goldfinch is a hefty carry but you will be lugging it around. It’s addictive, brilliantly written and worth every word.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>You can get your copy at the <a href="https://abc.nl/book-details/the-goldfinch/@9780349139630">American Book Center</a>.</em></p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" href="/life-in-the-netherlands/books/"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/books/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=260018</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 08:15:04 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Molly Quell]]></dc:creator></item></channel></rss>
