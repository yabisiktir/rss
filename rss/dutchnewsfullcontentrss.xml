The cabinet is urged to save Dutch residents’ DigiD data from the Trump Administration if the service is sold to the States. Experts warn thieves are targeting museums after an entire collection of antique silver disappears in Doesburg.

However, the more time spent on social media, the unhappier people become, he said.</p><p>The findings also show that, contrary to popular opinion, young people are not opposed to rules around social media use, Van der Veer said.  “The figures show an enormous shift in one year.
