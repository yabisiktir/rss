dozens of donor children without the knowledge of the women involved, including those who wanted to use their partner’s sperm.</p><p>The case is similar to that of fertility specialist <a

Clarke Award and longlisted for the Booker Prize, but the Dutch main character has an English name, swims on a mythical Rotterdam beach and refers to coffeeshops as “cafes” so this publication has some problems with the work. </strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2023 novel follows Leigh, born and raised in Rotterdam, whose proximity to the water draws her to marine biology, a path that eventually takes her to the edge of the solar system. Scottish author Martin MacInnes starts off strong, with stark prose and a nuanced understanding of abusive family dynamics, but the nearly 500-page work falls short by the end. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in her academic career, Leigh finds herself on a research vessel in the Caribbean exploring a recently opened sea vent. The depth is measured at least three times that of the Mariana Trench and Leigh volunteers to join several of her colleagues in exploring it. Testing doesn’t show anything unusual in the water but Leigh and her colleagues immediately start to have weird symptoms. </span></p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story then skips ahead to Leigh working in a mysterious lab on a project involving algae while trying to cope with her aging mother and the sister left behind. Her lab works together with others to form a new space agency, investigating not just the trench but the outer limits of our solar system. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Ascension portrays the complicated family dynamics – the three women navigating their relationship after the death of Leigh’s abusive father, her mother’s aging and the distance between them – impressively. The nuance is well done. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book does not have the same capacity for the nuance (or even basics) of Dutch culture. Even the name Leigh is not typically Dutch, in part because it would be pronounced differently than in English, and the work doesn’t address this. </span></p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She measures distance in feet and temperature in Fahrenheit. Leigh calls coffeeshops “cafes” and becomes a marine biologist because she grew up surrounded by water  which offers very little in the way of marine life. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book poses fascinating questions about the origins of life, how we came to be and what responsibilities children have to their parents but offers no answers. Regular readers of science fiction may find the book frustrating, as it opens with some interesting premises but then does not fully develop the world. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Ascension is the third work by MacInnes, whose debut novel, Infinite Ground, won the Somerset Maugham Award.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The writing is great but if you are familiar with the Netherlands, you will have to engage in some suspension of disbelief.</span></p><p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can buy your copy of In Ascension from the </span><a href="https://abc.nl/book-details/in-ascension/@9781838956271?affid=d3u6n86"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Book Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></em></p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" href="/life-in-the-netherlands/books/"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/books/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=261964</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 12:47:59 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Molly Quell]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Dutch music exports hit new high as dance continues to dominate</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/01/dutch-music-exports-hit-new-high-as-dance-continues-to-dominate/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-262156 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-art-and-culture category-economy category-music category-music-industry"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Dutch music exports hit new high as dance continues to dominate</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-01-13T12:30:32+00:00"> January 13, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-150588" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_150588"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="480" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Andre_Rieu_Ziggodome_P1080776.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Andre_Rieu_Ziggodome_P1080776.jpg 640w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Andre_Rieu_Ziggodome_P1080776-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Andre_Rieu_Ziggodome_P1080776-83x62.jpg 83w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Andre_Rieu_Ziggodome_P1080776-130x98.jpg 130w" width="640"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-150588"> Andre Rieu in action.

But Amsterdam city council, which owns 20% of the shares, said it was surprised by the news when approached by the Volkskrant.</p><p>Hester van Buren, the city’s alderman responsible for aviation, said: “I’m constantly being told: ‘We’re not talking about whether or not we introduce a night flying ban.
