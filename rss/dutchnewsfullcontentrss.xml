bicycles, safety experts have warned.</p><p>In a study commissioned by rail infrastructure operator ProRail, which has dozens of enclosed bike stores at major stations, the public safety institute NPIV found that an e-bike fire could destroy two rows of bicycles in 12 minutes.</p><p>The heat reached temperatures of up to 1,200C, while exploding battery fragments flew round the store, potentially spreading the fire to other bicycles.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center

proportion is expected to grow in the coming years.</p><p>In a series of 21 controlled experiments in bike stores, the NPIV found that a fire in an electric battery spread to other bikes within eight minutes and took another four minutes to destroy two stacked rows of 28 bicycles.</p><p>The NPIV says sprinkler systems need to be installed as standard in bike stores, as they can bring the temperature down rapidly to below 100C and limit the spread of a fire.</p><p>“A fire in a bike store in 2025 isn’t the same as 10 years ago,” Nils Rosmuller, energy and transport safety expert <a href="https://www.ad.nl/binnenland/onderzoek-inferno-in-fietsenstalling-dreigt-door-opmars-e-bikes-fatbike-brandt-het-hardst~a03f351a/">told AD.nl</a>. “The stores are designed for ordinary city bikes, but modern e-bikes have a much greater capacity for fire because of their powerful batteries and bigger quantities of plastic and rubber.”</p><p>Karen te Boome, head of stations at ProRail, said all bike stores at railway stations complied with safety laws and there had been no major incidents to date, but the regulations would be reviewed to take in the study’s findings.</p><p>“We have taken the initiative with this research in gaining more insight and knowledge about the potential risk of fire in bike stores,” she said.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none

Take energy labels, for example. What should you think about when deciding if A+ is essential or whether G is good enough?</strong></p><p>All homes which are listed for sale in the Netherlands must by law have an energy label, which tells prospective buyers about how energy-efficient they are. Homes with an A label or higher, for example, are considered to have “very low energy usage”.</p><p>They often will be fully insulated, may have solar panels or a heat pump to provide warmth in the winter. “Buying a home with a high energy label, such as A or B, can be <a href="https://www.abnamro.nl/en/personal/mortgages/sustainable-living/index.html?utm_id=cp8723097034&amp;utm_campaign=0131-36-25-aab-bmc-expats-xs-hoe-expats-sep25&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_source=direct-deal&amp;utm_content=dutchnews-SustainableLiving&amp;utm_term=0&amp;url_id=tid7741549308&amp;business_line=bmc&amp;utm_marketing_tactic=think&amp;cc_product=no-cc&amp;media_type=display-native&amp;po_number=5700081876&amp;publisher_channel=direct-deal&amp;campaign_type=start/stop">beneficial for multiple reasons</a>,” says ABN AMRO’s mortgage expert Steven Goedemans in the video below. “These homes are more energy efficient and therefore better for the environment. And as a bonus, they are usually more comfortable to live in.”</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TaWH8b6kv78?si=2eaRBkkrxf0U731c" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe></p><p>In addition, sustainable homes usually have a higher value than those with low energy labels and tend to hold their value over time, making them a smart investment for the future, when you come to sell.</p><p><strong>Mortgage interest discount<br/> </strong><br/> But there are other advantages too. ABN AMRO, for example, offers a discount on your mortgage interest if you buy a home with energy label B or higher. And even if your new home doesn’t have that label yet — you can still qualify.</p><p>If you improve your home’s energy label to A or B within 24 months of purchase, the discount will apply from the moment your new label is registered. That means you’ll save on mortgage costs, use less energy, and do something good for the planet at the same time.</p><p>And if the home you love has a label C or lower, no worries – there are also ways to improve its energy label. ABN AMRO offers financing options if you need extra budget to improve your home’s energy performance – whatever label it has. It might all sound complicated but a mortgage advisor will be able to go through all the options with you.</p><p>If you are considering buying a home, feel free to reach out to Steven or one of his

data-end="3962" data-start="3706">Catholic scholars and church representatives are calling for a comprehensive investigation into the harm women have suffered as a result of Catholic doctrine, <a href="https://www.trouw.nl/religie-filosofie/katholieke-experts-pleiten-voor-groot-onderzoek-naar-vrouwenleed-door-de-kerk-aangedaan~bc17cc98b/">Trouw</a> reported on Monday.</p><p data-end="4195" data-start="3964">The call for an inquiry mirrors earlier church-commissioned investigations into colonialism, slavery, the persecution of Jews, the oppression of indigenous peoples and sexual abuse, many of which were followed by Vatican apologies.</p><p data-end="4413" data-start="4197">Catholic psychologist Anke Bisschops told Trouw the church’s moral teachings had long caused harm to women, who were treated as “child-bearing machines” with serious consequences for their physical and mental health.</p><p data-end="4666" data-start="4415">She said any inquiry should examine both physical and emotional damage, including restrictions such as barring menstruating women from taking communion. “The church should don a hair shirt and admit it has made major mistakes towards women,” she said.</p><p data-end="4666" data-start="4415"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center

that priests performed caesarean incisions on women who could not give birth naturally, a practice that continued into the 20th century and was not limited to the Netherlands.</p><p data-end="5187" data-start="4668">The aim was to baptise the baby before death, based on the church’s teaching that an unbaptised child could not enter heaven. Poor hygiene meant the procedure — often carried out using a priest’s shaving knife — frequently resulted in the death of both mother and child.</p><p data-end="5300" data-start="5189">How widespread the practice was remains unclear, and the church has not yet formally responded to the findings.</p><p data-end="5300" data-start="5189"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8

data-start="5302">Dutch bishop Gerard de Korte told Trouw he acknowledged the historic caesarean practice and said it would be “useful” to establish its scale.</p><p data-end="5750" data-start="5445">Church historian Paul van Geest, a member of the Pontifical Academy of Theology, also backed an inquiry and said he had never heard of the priestly manual <em data-end="5619" data-start="5600">Embryologia Sacra</em>, which outlined the procedure. “The book was completely silenced — there is likely collective embarrassment behind that,” he said.</p><p data-end="5911" data-start="5752">De Korte and Van Geest both support a broader historical and theological investigation into the impact of Catholic moral teaching on women’s lives, Trouw said.</p><h2 data-end="5911" data-start="5752">Morally superior</h2><p data-end="6142" data-start="5913">Van Geest said such research should answer questions about how women, once viewed as morally superior by Augustine, later came to be regarded as inferior, and what forces drove the development of a morality that suppressed women.</p><p data-end="6356" data-start="6144">Bisschops described the belief that an unbaptised baby was “lost” and that a woman should be cut open to save its soul as “horrific superstition”, but said it reflected wider attitudes to women within the church.</p><p data-end="6555" data-start="6358">Dehue said she was surprised but pleased that there is now willingness to pursue such an inquiry nearly three years after her research appeared. “It is a very good idea — wonderful news,” she said.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center
