It may have been fitted into the surface of a table at one time, perhaps at an inn. That’s where people came together to play games and gamble – another favourite Roman occupation,” said museum curator Karen Jeneson.</p><p>The pattern puzzled investigators because it had little in common with other Roman games. However, the stone showed signs of wear and tear in places where a token would have moved, which implies intensive use, archaeologist and Roman game expert Walter Christ said.</p><p>Further investigation into the markings using a 3D scan revealed some lines where deeper than others, a clear sign that some moves were more frequent than others.</p><p>The next, and most innovative step, was to hand over the stone to Maastricht University researchers who used AI system Ludij to reconstruct the rules of the game.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>“We trained Ludij by feeding it the rules of some hundred games from the Middle Ages and older,” said researcher Dennis Roemer. “That gave us dozens of possible rules which Ludij used to play against itself, discovering some variations on the way. One set of rules resulted in the same wear and tear pattern as was found on the stone.”</p><p>The system may not have found the definitive rules, however, Roemer said. “When fed with a line pattern, Ludij will always find rules,” he said, “but that doesn’t mean the Romans played it in the exact same way.”</p><p>The aim of the game was probably to block the opponent’s tokens, a type of game that was played in the Middle Ages and which has now been found to date from much earlier times, Jeneson said.</p><p>The museum has provided a pdf version of the game which can be downloaded <a href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67cabb313a4e334994b1c5c7/6989be47f306c4d37531a159_Spelregels%20Romeins%20bordspel.pdf">here</a>.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/ai/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/gaming/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/limburg/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/society/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=263466</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 13:44:16 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Hanneke Sanou]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>The Netherlands needs more influencers from the United States</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/02/the-netherlands-needs-more-influencers-from-the-united-states/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-263457 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-expats category-social-media type-column"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> The Netherlands needs more influencers from the United States</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-02-11T13:36:38+00:00"> February 11, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-190854" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_190854"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="427" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_8785.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_8785.jpg 640w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_8785-560x374.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_8785-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_8785-92x62.jpg 92w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_8785-130x87.jpg 130w" width="640"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-190854"> Photo: DutchNews.nl</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Last month, Molly Quell asked in <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/01/an-influx-of-influencers/">her regular column</a> if the Netherlands can survive the onslaught of American influencers.

American influencers speak of the Netherlands, and Europe, with admiration and affection, which is far different than the rhetoric coming from the White House.</p><p dir="ltr">Know what influencers especially love? Dutch urban design. This is your chance to influence the very nation whose car-centric lifestyle is most likely to cause the Netherlands to be flooded by rising sea levels.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Salvage Nato</h2><p dir="ltr">What if by welcoming more selfie-stick wielding YouTubers, the Dutch can change the course of American elections, salvage Nato and the EU, and pump the brakes on climate change? Not to mention winning the eternal gratitude of the Italians by relieving their over-touristed cities.</p><p dir="ltr">Dutch power would reach heights not seen since the Golden Age, except this time that power would rest on the free labour of American DAFT visa holders, rather than brutally colonising and exploiting foreign nations.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to American influencers, go ahead, smash that like button.</p><p dir="ltr"><em><span class="il">Chad</span> Lykins moved to Amsterdam in November 2025 from the United States, where he worked in policy, politics, and youth organisations.
