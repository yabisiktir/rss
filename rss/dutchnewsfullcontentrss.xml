class="px-4"><p>Dutch airline KLM and another 20 European air carriers have committed to stopping using misleading claims about “CO2 neutral flights” or the benefits of alternative aviation fuels, following a complaint by consumer organisations.</p><p>In June 2023, European consumer group BEUC and 23 of its member organisations, including Dutch consumer authority Consumentenbond, denounced claims by 17 airlines suggesting that air travel could be “sustainable” or “green”.</p><p>After a 1.5-year investigation, the European Commission said on Friday that 21 airlines had agreed to change their practices.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center

contributions to climate projects elsewhere in the world, or that the use of alternative aviation fuels – not yet ready for the market – can significantly reduce the climate impact of flying.</p><p>The companies will also refrain from using vague terms about achieving climate goals in the future and provide instead clear timelines or evidence to support their claims.</p><p>The announcement followed dialogue with the EU executive led by the Dutch consumers authority ACM, together with the consumers authorities of Belgium, Norway and Spain.</p><div class="ad-container

continue monitoring sustainability claims and enforce them where necessary,” she said. “This is good news for consumers, who will no longer be misled by misleading sustainability promises that suggest sustainable flying is possible.”</p><p><a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2024/03/klm-misled-consumers-with-green-claims-court-rules/">In March 2024</a>, a court in Amsterdam ruled that KLM had misled

Photo: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><p>Some people come to the Netherlands for a job, while some of their partners carry on working remotely for theirs, which is based in another country.</p><p>But when that happens, the foreign employer has new obligations around administration and withholding tax – and this is the moment when it can be good to involve an expert.</p><p>“International companies that are not based in the Netherlands could have employees working in the Netherlands for a number of reasons” says Sandro, a payroll expert at tax advice firm Blue Umbrella.</p><p>“For example, people move here with a 30% ruling [tax break for scarce talent] and their partner keeps on working for a US company. The company says: you are working from home, but ‘from home’ suddenly means working from home in the Netherlands.”</p><h2>Staying longer</h2><p>Research by the Dutch statistics office CBS earlier this year found that employees coming to the Netherlands are more likely to stay longer if they have children and if their partner has a paid job. A report from the Advisory Council on Migration in the summer suggested that the partners of knowledge migrants could help fill job vacancies in the Netherlands.</p><p>But since learning Dutch is not an instant process, and Dutch recruitment can be challenging, Blue Umbrella sees may people continue to work for their old international employers.</p><p>That means payroll administration needs to be set up, Dutch taxes need to be paid monthly to the <em>Belastingdienst</em>, and foreign companies also need to deal with the fact that exchange rates can vary. Setting up a Dutch bank account is tricky for non-resident entities and there are bank fees involved with transferring money.</p><h2>A solution</h2><p>Blue Umbrella has one solution – the<a href="https://www.blueumbrella.nl/payroll-services"> PoBo</a> (“payment on behalf of”) package. Like a deposit account, this holds several months of salary and fees, and then Blue Umbrella ensures the worker is paid the correct amount on time, payroll administration is up to date and the tax bill is settled.</p><p>“Besides the fact that you as an employer have lower transfer fees, it’s also just easier to transfer one large amount and then we do the specifications,” says Sandro. “We specify the payment reference, we use the right bank account number to the Dutch tax office. It makes it easier.”</p><p>The PoBo service also prevents annoying mix-ups such as companies that do not realise every payment to the tax office needs a new reference number.</p><h2>Reference numbers</h2><p>“What goes wrong when they pay themselves is sometimes forgetting a payment reference, which sounds silly, but every month the payment reference is different,” Sandro says. “They cannot just pay the tax office: they really have to mention their payment. And not paying on time is another thing. We do see that people receive fines for paying too late.”</p><p>Blue Umbrella’s PoBo service costs an additional €25 a month on top of the €89 a month standard payroll service – and is being used by clients from America, Germany, Denmark and other European countries.</p><p>“Employees like to get paid their salary on time – although you hear from them quicker if it doesn’t happen!” says Sandro. “And their employers like the simplicity.”</p><p><a href="https://www.blueumbrella.nl/contact"><em>Contact Blue Umbrella</em></a><em> for advice on all of your tax and business affairs in the Netherlands</em></p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/tax/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=259620</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 11:21:08 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Foster parents face 11 years in jail for abusing four children</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/11/foster-parents-face-11-years-in-jail-for-abusing-four-children/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-259708 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-abuse category-children category-court-cases category-society"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Foster parents face 11 years in jail for abusing four children</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2025-11-08T11:19:11+00:00"> November 8, 2025 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-0" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_0"></figure><main class="px-4"><p>The public prosecution department has called for an 11-year jail term followed by detention in a psychiatric clinic for a couple who physically abused their foster daughter.</p><p>Johnny van den B en Daisy W appeared in court this week, charged with serious physical abuse and depriving the girl of her liberty, as well as abusing three other foster children.</p><p>The<a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2024/05/vlaardingen-foster-child-beaten-into-hospital-called-for-help/"> case</a> came to light in May 2024 when the then 10-year-old girl was hospitalised with life-threatening injuries and in a coma after being repeatedly abused by the couple at their home in Vlaardingen.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>It later emerged that the neighbours, the girl’s school and the girl herself had <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2024/05/vlaardingen-foster-child-beaten-into-hospital-called-for-help/">sounded the alarm</a> about her treatment but that she had been left in the care of the couple.</p><p>The girl has since woken from her coma but is unable to sit up or walk unaided and can’t talk.
