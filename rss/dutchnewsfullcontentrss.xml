discovery of a cow and two cats that<a href="https://www.wur.nl/en/news/first-case-avian-influenza-antibodies-cow-europe"> tested positive</a> for the virus on a Frisian dairy farm.</p><p>An analysis of the milk of the cow was carried out last week when the two cats showed symptoms, and revealed it had recovered from a bout of bird flu.</p><p>According to experts, the spread of bird flu among mammals increases the risk for humans, particularly in such densely populated countries as the Netherlands where animals and people live in close proximity.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden

indicate for the first time that Dutch dairy farms are susceptible to the virus, bird flu expert Thijs Kuiken said. “Until now, we only knew of cows in the United States that had the virus and on a much larger scale, with 1,084 farms in 19 states,” he told the <a href="https://fd.nl/samenleving/1584740/experts-besmette-koe-is-waarschuwing-voor-nieuwe-fase-van-vogelgriep">Financieele Dagblad.</a></p><p>Lab experiments had already shown that variant of the virus was present in European countries but it was assumed that aspects of US dairy farm practices, such as the size of the farms and frequent transports from farm to farm were to blame for the outbreaks.</p><p>One of the reasons the Netherlands has become the second country to have discovered the virus in a cow is a greater emphasis on testing cows on farms close to poultry farms following the American outbreaks, Wageningen University researcher Wim van der Poel told the paper.</p><div class="ad-container

bird flu has become obsolete, Van der Poel said. Seals, foxes, ferrets and cats are just some of the mammals that can carry the virus. “If more species are contaminated the exposure of people to the virus also increases. The virus will also adapt as infections spread. That is worrying and a good reason to monitor infection in mammals,” he said.</p><p>Some 40 of the 71 cases of bird flu in humans in the United States were a result of cow to human contact, Kuiken said. “I am not expecting those numbers in the Netherlands but cows pose an extra risk,” he said. “Brussels must also get is skates on about allowing possible <a href="https://www.dvm360.com/view/european-agency-recommends-marketing-authorization-for-avian-flu-vaccines">vaccines</a>.

The stretch of road is a major traffic black spot and plans to expand it were first launched in 2020.</p><p>The motion, submitted by GroenLinks-PvdA MPs Habtuma de Hoop, Sandra Beckerman and Ines Kostic (SP), made no mention of the environmental aspects of the plan. Instead,<a href="https://www.tweedekamer.nl/kamerstukken/moties/detail?id=2026Z01161&amp;did=2026D02755"> it states that</a> there is a shortage of investment on the roads and railways and that the A12/A27 expansion plan should be withdrawn.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>The motion, supported by the CDA and D66 from the pending new coalition, also called on the government to work on an alternative plan for the motorway which makes better use of the existing space.</p><p>Environmental organisation Natuur &amp; Milieu said it was “unbelievably happy” with the decision to implement the alternative plan, which it said “is broadly supported” and a good example for other big infrastructure projects.</p><p>Other organisations, including action group Amelisweerd said the decision was “a validation of the years of protests by the locals”.</p><p>In the 1970s and 1980s, the original construction of the A27 which cuts through the east side of the reserve, was the subject of fierce protests, resulting in the “<a href="https://anderetijden.nl/aflevering/135/De-slag-om-Amelisweerd">battle for Amelisweerd</a>”.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/environment/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/infrastructure/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/road-safety/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=262811</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 10:23:22 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Hanneke Sanou]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Haul of €250m of cocaine found in magnets shipped from Ecuador</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/01/haul-of-e250m-of-cocaine-found-in-magnets-shipped-from-ecuador/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-262826 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-crime category-drugs"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Haul of €250m of cocaine found in magnets shipped from Ecuador</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-01-28T10:14:44+00:00"> January 28, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-262830" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_262830"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="833" sizes="(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/27012026-magneet-3.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/27012026-magneet-3.jpg 1250w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/27012026-magneet-3-560x373.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/27012026-magneet-3-1200x800.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/27012026-magneet-3-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/27012026-magneet-3-768x512.jpg 768w" width="1250"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-262830"> Photo: Openbare Ministerie</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><p>Nearly five tonnes of cocaine have been seized in what customs officers say is one of the biggest shipments of drugs ever intercepted on its way to the Netherlands.</p><p>The 4,830 kilos of drugs, with an estimated street value of €250 million, were hidden in two containers filled with electric magnets being transported from Ecuador.</p><p>Customs officers picked up the unusual cargo when the containers were scanned in Rotterdam on January 8 and 9.
