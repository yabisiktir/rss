plans to cut spending on jobless benefits (WW), Dutch trade unions have <a href="https://www.ad.nl/politiek/gevolgen-kabinetsplan-werkloze-krijgt-tot-900-euro-per-maand-minder~aa676629/">told the AD</a>.</p><p data-end="325" data-start="140">Calculations by the FNV and CNV union federations show that the proposed reforms would significantly reduce both the level and duration of payments for many future claimants.</p><p data-end="520" data-start="327">The coalition parties D66, VVD and CDA have agreed to cut around €1.5 billion from the WW budget partly by reducing the maximum duration of benefits from 24 months to 12 months.</p><p data-end="849" data-start="522">In addition, the new administration plans to lower the cap on maximum payments to €3,700 a month from the current €4,600 a month, hitting higher earners. WW benefits are based on 70% of last earning salary up to the maximum.</p><p data-end="849" data-start="522"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1209" data-start="851">The FNV estimates that around 24% of current claimants would receive less if the new rules were applied to them and warns that percentage could rise, pointing to recent job cuts at <span class="hover:entity-accent entity-underline inline cursor-pointer align-baseline"><span class="whitespace-normal">Heineken</span></span>, <span class="hover:entity-accent entity-underline inline cursor-pointer align-baseline"><span class="whitespace-normal">ING</span></span> and <span class="hover:entity-accent entity-underline inline cursor-pointer align-baseline"><span class="whitespace-normal">ASML</span></span>.</p><p data-end="1658" data-start="1425">Anyone earning around €5,000 gross a month, including holiday pay and a possible 13th month, would face lower benefits if they became unemployed under the new rules, the union said.</p><p data-end="2006" data-start="1660">Halving the maximum duration from 24 to 12 months would also have a major impact, particularly on people over 55, who often find it hardest to return to work. The CNV calculates that an older, higher-earning employee could lose up to €66,000 in benefits as a result of both the lower cap and the shorter duration.</p><p data-end="2006" data-start="1660"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="2301" data-start="2008">Younger workers would also be hit.
