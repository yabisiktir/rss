The increase is particularly noticeable among children aged up to 14.</p><p data-end="735" data-start="494">The rise is steeper than at the same point last year, said Nivel researcher Mariëtte Hooiveld, but it is not unprecedented. “In 2023 the increase started even earlier, and in 2022 levels were roughly comparable to what we see now,” she said.</p><p data-end="735" data-start="494"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="955" data-start="737">In England, a mutated form of the H3N2 virus has led to what some have dubbed a “super flu”. While that label suggests something more serious, experts stress that the variant is mainly more contagious, not more severe.</p><p data-end="1249" data-start="957">In the Netherlands, two different flu viruses are currently circulating, Hooiveld said. “We’re not seeing anything particularly unusual,” she told RTL NIeuws. “If this were a variant against which the flu jab offered poor protection, you would expect many more older people to fall ill. That isn’t the case.”</p><p data-end="2712" data-start="2482">Immunologist Ger Rijkers said it is inevitable the British virus will reach the Netherlands. “Viruses don’t respect borders,” he said.

In 2020, starters accounted for just 27% of home purchases.</p><p data-end="502" data-start="292">The increase is largely due to government measures aimed at improving access to the housing market, including the exemption from transfer tax and the introduction of buy-to-let restrictions, the Kadaster said.</p><p data-end="790" data-start="504">Another key factor is a sell-off wave by private landlords, who are disposing of their properties because tighter regulation has made renting less profitable. Former rental homes are often smaller and relatively affordable, making them appealing to first-time buyers, the Kadaster said.</p><p data-end="800" data-start="792"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1074" data-start="802">The effect is particularly visible in cities.

In the next 40 largest council areas, almost half of buyers are now purchasing their first home.</p><p data-end="1353" data-start="1076">Nevertheless, the agency points out, average house prices have risen by 43% since 2020, almost twice as fast as average incomes. As a result, many first-time buyers can no longer borrow enough to cover the purchase price.</p><p data-end="1600" data-start="1355">Starters are therefore increasingly forced to use their own savings or other sources of income. Single buyers put an average of €47,000 of their own money into a home this year, while couples contributed around €17,000, reflecting their higher combined borrowing capacity.</p><p data-end="1612" data-start="1602"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1812" data-start="1614">Separate research by ING shows that housing shortages are widening the gap between generations, with more than half of Gen Z respondents saying they are worried about their future housing prospects, the <a href="https://www.ad.nl/wonen/hoe-de-woningnood-de-generatiekloof-vergroot-als-starters-al-een-huis-kunnen-kopen-is-het-40-vierkante-meter~a6fd7f5d/">AD reported on Thursday</a>.
