The result was a shortage of workers. That meant students, school pupils like me, had to work. Normally you were not allowed to, but we had to ‘help our country’ for one month during the summer holiday.<br/> <br data-end="1100" data-start="1097"/>I was working with a friend in a seaside hotel resort because we thought that would be much more fun than picking vegetables. And there was this 17-year-old Dutch boy on holiday with his parents and we fell in love.<br/> <br data-end="1318" data-start="1315"/>That autumn the Berlin Wall fell, and his parents invited me and my family to visit them for New Year. We stayed for three weeks and it was the beginning of a romance. Two years later, when I finished high school, I came to the Netherlands and I stayed. I lived first with his parents while I went to Tilburg University to study law, and they became like parents to me.<br/> <br data-end="1690" data-start="1687"/>We broke up just before Covid, after 30 years together.</p><p data-end="1747" data-start="697"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="2161" data-start="1749"><strong data-end="1828" data-start="1749">How do you describe yourself – an expat, lovepat, immigrant, international?</strong><br data-end="1831" data-start="1828"/>Certainly not an expat or immigrant. I identify myself as Bulgarian Dutch. I’m both. I’m a European as well. But I think I find it easy to feel at home anywhere. I lived for three months in California and I could see how I could fit in there as well. My new partner is British and London feels like a second home to me nowadays.</p><p data-end="2340" data-start="2163"><strong data-end="2196" data-start="2163">How long do you plan to stay?</strong><br data-end="2199" data-start="2196"/>I’ve no plans to leave: my children are here and we are happy.

I was signed up for a course in Breda three days a week, and they were very strict with me from the beginning. If I said a sentence wrong or pronounced a word the wrong way, they would correct me.</p><p>But it is fair to say that I do learn languages easily, which allowed me to start my law studies (in Dutch) only one year after I had arrived in the Netherlands. I am trained as a Dutch lawyer.</p><p data-end="2971" data-start="2342"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="3515" data-start="2973"><strong data-end="3011" data-start="2973">What’s your favourite Dutch thing?</strong><br data-end="3014" data-start="3011"/>What always struck me is how neat and tidy the Netherlands is. Amsterdam is not a good example, but I remember flying over the fields and seeing how everything is so well planned and used. A lot of thought has gone into it.</p><p>You could say we are now a bit overregulated, but what I find incredible is that such a small country has the impact it has with relatively few resources. We don’t have mountains to bring in tourists. But the most has been made of what is there, and I think that is a talent.</p><p data-end="4129" data-start="3517"><strong data-end="3547" data-start="3517">How Dutch have you become?</strong><br data-end="3550" data-start="3547"/>My late mother would say I have become very Dutch, and because I am so well integrated, many Dutch colleagues and friends thought I was born and raised here. But I wasn’t, and so all the nostalgia about Dutch children’s TV shows from the 70s that everyone of my generation remembers passes me by.  I can’t talk about them.</p><p data-end="4129" data-start="3517">But apart from that, I think I had a pretty similar youth to most children here from average families. And I think children are the same the world over. They play with the same things, they like sweets. That is something constant, no matter where you are.</p><p data-end="4737" data-start="4131"><strong data-end="4204" data-start="4131">Which three Dutch people (dead or alive) would you most like to meet?</strong><br data-end="4207" data-start="4204"/>Theo van Gogh: I would like to ask him if making the film he made (<em data-end="4286" data-start="4274">Submission</em>) and paid for with his life was worth it, and whether he would do it again.</p><p data-end="4737" data-start="4131">Audrey Hepburn: I want to know what her life was like in Arnhem in those days, where she used to go and what she did at the weekend. My first real job was in Arnhem and I am fascinated by the city in the pre–World War II years.</p><p data-end="4737" data-start="4131">And Vincent van Gogh: I would ask him, if he were alive and able to reap all the fruits of his talent, what he would do with all that money.</p><p data-end="5280" data-start="4739"><strong data-end="4771" data-start="4739">What’s your top tourist tip?</strong><br data-end="4774" data-start="4771"/>Den Bosch and Heusden. Heusden is a very charming place, very small and very Dutch. It’s a fortified village on the Maas river, a bit like being in Madurodam. It was a very poor village so it has remained in its original state and has slowly been restored.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-259746" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_259746" style="width: 560px"><noscript><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-259746" decoding="async" height="420" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0672-560x420.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0672-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0672-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0672-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0672-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0672.jpg 1862w" width="560"/></noscript><img alt="" class="lazyload size-medium wp-image-259746" data-sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" data-src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0672-560x420.jpg" data-srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0672-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0672-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0672-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0672-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0672.jpg 1862w" decoding="async" height="420" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20560%20420%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="560"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-259746">Heusden’s harbour, complete with windmill.

It’s close to Den Bosch so you can do both together.</p><p data-end="5973" data-start="5282"><strong data-end="5353" data-start="5282">Tell us something surprising you’ve found out about the Netherlands</strong><br data-end="5356" data-start="5353"/>What surprised me is the way everyone was on their bikes, and in the south where I grew up, everyone is friendly to each other. You say hello to complete strangers, people you have never met. And the way you congratulate everyone else on a birthday… in fact, the whole birthday celebration thing.<br/> <br data-end="5655" data-start="5652"/>In Bulgaria when someone has a birthday you really want to give them a nice present, so you all club together with as much cash as you can afford and buy a nice big gift. In the Netherlands it struck me in the early days that you actually pool your money with others to buy a present so everyone can contribute less.</p><p data-end="6699" data-start="5975"><strong data-end="6047" data-start="5975">If you had just 24 hours left in the Netherlands, what would you do?</strong><br data-end="6050" data-start="6047"/>Forever? I would go for a walk in Bokhoven on the Maas. I hope it is summer, and in that case I would cycle from Bokhoven to Heusden and have lunch there, probably at the pancake house – you have good restaurants all over the world but not pancakes. That would be in the morning.</p><p>In the afternoon, I would go to the City Park IJzeren Vrouw in Den Bosch and walk from there to the centre of town. Visit the cathedral (the biggest one in the Netherlands, and I even prefer it to the Notre-Dame in Paris) and wander through my favourite streets and little shops, go to the Noordbrabants Museum. I would take my time, so I am zen when I have to leave.</p><p data-end="6798" data-start="6701"><em>Ianika Tzankova is a lawyer with <a href="https://www.rubiconlitigation.com/">Rubicon Impact and

Reporting will be annual for firms with 250 or more staff and every three years for those with between 100 and 250. Employers must act if the gap exceeds 5%.</p><p data-end="1737" data-start="1469">Employer organisation VNO-NCW supports the aim of the law but calls the proposals “extremely complex” and demanding, the FD said.

On second glance, you see the imprints of hands, stamped in red paint and climbing up the walls.</p><p>This is the opening of a new exhibition on slavery in both Roman and colonial times – and how the laws created for one were later used to justify and legitimise the other.</p><p>Not My Soul, open at the <a href="https://www.allardpierson.nl/en/calendar/not-my-soul">Allard Pierson Museum</a> in Amsterdam and running until May 24, has been made in partnership with the planned <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2024/02/tell-the-whole-story-slavery-museum-planned-for-java-eiland/">National Slavery Museum</a>. Using objects from its archaeological and “Surinamica” collections, it analyses slavery through the ages – and its impact today, through modern artworks.</p><p>While many records of the enslaved have disappeared, or were preserved only in folklore and song, the exhibition finds clues at the margins of official documents. A signature on the bottom of a piece of Roman pottery is one clue – another is a print depicting Susanna and her two children, who were sold instead of being freed as intended after the master (and their father’s) death.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>Isabelle Best, curator of the Surinamese collection at the Allard Pierson, said the wealth of documentation justifying colonial slavery demonstrates a kind of moral whitewashing. “It is important to realise that to dehumanise a person, you have to work very hard,” she said.</p><p>“So administration, laws, legal but also religious documents were used during the colonial period as instruments of the state and employed to make a person into a thing. They were published by colonial authorities to put the colonial elite in a situation where they could take ownership of other people and make them into slaves.”</p><p><strong>Banned</strong></p><p>A room full of Dutch documents referring to Roman laws during the colonial era demonstrates this attempt to justify slavery – despite the fact that vassalage had been banned in the Netherlands. “Actually, they were given a kind of excuse,” said Best. “They didn’t have to take responsibility for their deeds. It was all ordered like this.”</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>In ancient Roman and Greek times, the exhibition points out, slavery was part of society. Laurien de Gelder, curator of the archaeological collection on West Asia and the Greek world at the Allard Pierson, said that in the latter years of the Roman Empire, some 10% to 30% of people were enslaved.</p><p>Although some could earn their freedom, many could not – and no real stories have survived about groups such as those mining silver and precious metals in appalling conditions, she said. But while administrators in colonial times pointed to Roman slavery to justify transporting African and Asian people as slaves, in the Roman period, slavery was not racialised.</p><p>“There were enslaved people from Nubia, in the south of Egypt, for example,” she said. “An enslaved person of colour was seen as ‘luxury goods’, something exotic…But systematic exclusion on the basis of skin colour is really a characteristic of transatlantic slavery.”</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-260237" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_260237" style="width: 560px"><noscript><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-260237" decoding="async" height="420" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8662-560x420.jpeg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8662-560x420.jpeg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8662-1200x900.jpeg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8662-768x576.jpeg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8662-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8662-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w" width="560"/></noscript><img alt="" class="lazyload size-medium wp-image-260237" data-sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" data-src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8662-560x420.jpeg" data-srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8662-560x420.jpeg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8662-1200x900.jpeg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8662-768x576.jpeg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8662-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8662-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w" decoding="async" height="420" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20560%20420%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="560"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-260237">Photo S Boztas</figcaption></figure><p>The exhibition puts stories of enslaved people in the spotlight – the gravestone created by a Roman father for his son, who died two years before he would reach the age of 30 and freedom, for example.</p><p>A replica of Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux’s statue “Why born enslaved?” captures, and sexualises, the resistance of a young black woman.
