<a href="https://fd.nl/bedrijfsleven/1577046/magnum-paait-vooral-britse-beleggers-met-onbelaste-kapitaaluitkering">Financieele Dagblad</a> said on Tuesday.</p><p data-end="817" data-start="426">Magnum

href="https://news.magnumicecream.com/the-magnum-ice-cream-company-public-filing-of-sec-registration-statement/">US Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC), the company intends to use a Dutch tax

data-end="1236" data-start="858">The arrangement mainly benefits Unilever’s British shareholders, who will receive Magnum shares as part of the split. The UK does not levy dividend tax, while the Netherlands does.</p><p data-end="1236" data-start="858">Dutch investors can offset the 15% tax through their income tax, but British investors cannot. This difference was decisive in 2020, when Unilever chose London over Rotterdam for its head office.</p><p data-end="1469" data-start="1238">Under the Dutch scheme, payments that are classed as a return of paid-in capital are not subject to dividend tax. Magnum expects to have sufficient reserves after the split to make these tax-free payments for at least five years.</p><p data-end="1512" data-start="1471"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1842" data-start="1514">Other companies, including OCI, Shell, AkzoNobel, TomTom, Van Lanschot Kempen, HAL and Heineken Holding, have used similar arrangements. The practice is legal but has drawn criticism in the Dutch parliament and some tax experts have suggested that in practice such payments often resemble dividends and should therefore be taxed.</p><p data-end="2717" data-start="2512">The UK tax agency HMRC has also approved the arrangement, describing the planned payments as being made for “bona fide commercial reasons” and not as a form of tax avoidance, according to the SEC filing, the FD said.</p><p data-end="3054" data-start="2719">Unilever and Magnum said the tax treatment was one of several factors behind the decision to locate in Amsterdam.</p><p data-end="3054" data-start="2719">Before the scheme can be implemented, Magnum must reduce the nominal value of its shares, a move that still requires formal shareholder approval.

While maternity care is largely covered by the basic health insurance package, some new parents go without because they cannot afford the €5.40 an hour they have to pay from their own pocket.

The VVD in The Hague wants to abolish the right to claim asylum once in the Netherlands and send back all refugees who arrived uninvited at the border.</p><p>The “return hubs” should only be used as a means of last resort, Azmani said. But he said European countries should be able to refuse asylum seekers who had already been rejected by other members and the European Commission should impose tougher penalties on countries that refused to receive them.</p><p>“People will soon get the message once: ‘You must go back’,” Azmani said. “And if you try to go from one country to another, you’ll keep coming up against the same decision.”</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/immigration/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/politics/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/refugees/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=259826</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 11:23:39 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Gordon Darroch]]></dc:creator></item></channel></rss>
