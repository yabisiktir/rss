In response, then infrastructure minister Barry Madlener said supervision would be stepped up by the transport ministry’s inspection agency (ILT), the product safety authority NVWA, and customs officers.</p><p data-end="1024" data-start="695">Nine months later, little has changed. The ILT told the Parool that only one inspection project is currently planned, while the NVWA said it has had “no reason” to seize unsafe electric bicycles this year. The ILT’s last press release on fatbikes dates from September 2024, when <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2024/09/inspectors-intercept-over-16000-illegal-fatbikes-from-china/">16,500 illegal Chinese bikes</a> were intercepted.</p><p data-end="1024" data-start="695"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1271" data-start="1026">Both watchdogs say they have been in talks with online platforms, and that fewer illegal models are now being offered for sale. Bol.com said it had removed 121 listings this year, while Marktplaats declined to give figures but said it is taking action.</p><p data-end="1581" data-start="1273">Nevertheless, industry groups say those efforts fall far short of what is needed. “The legal market is under control, but illegal fatbikes remain easy to find online,” a spokesman for the RAI Vereniging, which represents the bicycle industry, told the paper. “The promised increase in enforcement has not yet produced results.”</p><p data-end="1789" data-start="1583">Police also report no visible improvement, and responsibility for enforcement remains divided between the different agencies. The ILT monitors mopeds, the NVWA checks electric bicycles, and fatbikes often fall between the two categories.</p><p data-end="1789" data-start="1583"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1982" data-start="1791">The ILT and NVWA now say they will begin joint inspections by the end of 2025. “We have invested this year in cooperation with customs and the police to achieve more results,” the ILT said.</p><p data-end="2233" data-start="1984">Manufacturers say stronger action is overdue. “The ILT and NVWA have been asleep for too long,” said Mels van Hoolwerff of Dutch fatbike brand Phatfour. “If you add up the cost of parts, labour and transport, it’s impossible to make a fatbike that cheap.”</p><p data-end="2421" data-start="2235">Estimates of how many fatbikes are now in circulation vary widely. Industry insiders believe there could be as many as half a million, with up to half sold through unofficial channels.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/court-cases/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/cycling/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/fatbikes/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/society/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=259719</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 08:21:49 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Til hat-trick for PSV sinks AZ as Ajax lose again at Utrecht</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/11/til-hat-trick-for-psv-sinks-az-as-ajax-lose-again-at-utrecht/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-259714 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-eredivisie category-football category-sport"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Til hat-trick for PSV sinks AZ as Ajax lose again at Utrecht</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2025-11-09T20:44:34+00:00"> November 9, 2025 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-259715" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_259715"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="1706" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ANP-541697325-scaled.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ANP-541697325-scaled.jpg 2560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ANP-541697325-560x373.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ANP-541697325-1200x800.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ANP-541697325-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ANP-541697325-768x512.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ANP-541697325-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ANP-541697325-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" width="2560"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-259715"> Guus Til claims the match ball after his hat-trick against AZ.

Photo: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><p>Some people come to the Netherlands for a job, while some of their partners carry on working remotely for theirs, which is based in another country.</p><p>But when that happens, the foreign employer has new obligations around administration and withholding tax – and this is the moment when it can be good to involve an expert.</p><p>“International companies that are not based in the Netherlands could have employees working in the Netherlands for a number of reasons” says Sandro, a payroll expert at tax advice firm Blue Umbrella.</p><p>“For example, people move here with a 30% ruling [tax break for scarce talent] and their partner keeps on working for a US company. The company says: you are working from home, but ‘from home’ suddenly means working from home in the Netherlands.”</p><h2>Staying longer</h2><p>Research by the Dutch statistics office CBS earlier this year found that employees coming to the Netherlands are more likely to stay longer if they have children and if their partner has a paid job. A report from the Advisory Council on Migration in the summer suggested that the partners of knowledge migrants could help fill job vacancies in the Netherlands.</p><p>But since learning Dutch is not an instant process, and Dutch recruitment can be challenging, Blue Umbrella sees may people continue to work for their old international employers.</p><p>That means payroll administration needs to be set up, Dutch taxes need to be paid monthly to the <em>Belastingdienst</em>, and foreign companies also need to deal with the fact that exchange rates can vary. Setting up a Dutch bank account is tricky for non-resident entities and there are bank fees involved with transferring money.</p><h2>A solution</h2><p>Blue Umbrella has one solution – the<a href="https://www.blueumbrella.nl/payroll-services"> PoBo</a> (“payment on behalf of”) package. Like a deposit account, this holds several months of salary and fees, and then Blue Umbrella ensures the worker is paid the correct amount on time, payroll administration is up to date and the tax bill is settled.</p><p>“Besides the fact that you as an employer have lower transfer fees, it’s also just easier to transfer one large amount and then we do the specifications,” says Sandro. “We specify the payment reference, we use the right bank account number to the Dutch tax office. It makes it easier.”</p><p>The PoBo service also prevents annoying mix-ups such as companies that do not realise every payment to the tax office needs a new reference number.</p><h2>Reference numbers</h2><p>“What goes wrong when they pay themselves is sometimes forgetting a payment reference, which sounds silly, but every month the payment reference is different,” Sandro says. “They cannot just pay the tax office: they really have to mention their payment. And not paying on time is another thing. We do see that people receive fines for paying too late.”</p><p>Blue Umbrella’s PoBo service costs an additional €25 a month on top of the €89 a month standard payroll service – and is being used by clients from America, Germany, Denmark and other European countries.</p><p>“Employees like to get paid their salary on time – although you hear from them quicker if it doesn’t happen!” says Sandro. “And their employers like the simplicity.”</p><p><a href="https://www.blueumbrella.nl/contact"><em>Contact Blue Umbrella</em></a><em> for advice on all of your tax and business affairs in the Netherlands</em></p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/tax/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=259620</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 11:21:08 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Foster parents face 11 years in jail for abusing four children</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/11/foster-parents-face-11-years-in-jail-for-abusing-four-children/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-259708 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-abuse category-children category-court-cases category-society"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Foster parents face 11 years in jail for abusing four children</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2025-11-08T11:19:11+00:00"> November 8, 2025 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156363" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_156363"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="398" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/court-room.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/court-room.jpg 600w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/court-room-560x371.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/court-room-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/court-room-92x62.jpg 92w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/court-room-130x86.jpg 130w" width="600"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-156363"> A Dutch courtroom.
