Euthanasia accounts for 5.8% – or 10,000 – of all deaths a year.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>People who choose to starve to death often do so at home but it also takes place in hospices or nursing homes. Two-thirds would have preferred euthanasia and a third explicitly named the rejection of their request as the reason for stopping to eat and drink, according to close relatives and friends of the deceased.</p><p>The researchers examined two of the best-known methods of ending one’s life independently, without the direct help of a doctor. After starvation, a deadly combination of pills is the most frequently used option.</p><p>Some 2,000 people, representing 1.2% of all deaths, end their lives like this, a number has not significantly changed in 20 years.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>Support from doctors or relatives of people who want to starve themselves to death, such as by administering painkillers or making them more comfortable by wetting their mouths, is not illegal. The method is not seen as suicide and is registered as “death from natural causes”.</p><p>“We hear from people that doctors sometimes steer people that way,” Fransien van ter Beek of the Dutch right-to-die association NVVE told the Volkskrant. “It certainly happens in cases where the case is very complex and doctors don’t want to get into trouble over euthanasia,” she said.</p><p>Two-thirds of people who starve themselves to death are over 80. Those who opted for pills were mostly aged between 30 and 70, often had mental problems and had tried to commit suicide before.</p><h2>Completed life</h2><p>The main reasons for ending their lives ranged from considering their life “completed”,  loss of dignity or a sense of meaninglessness, pain or loss of independence. Part of the group valued being able to decide for themselves as the main driver.</p><p>“With the proper preparation and support from friends or relatives and doctors, the conscious decision to stop eating and drinking can lead to a dignified death,” researcher Fenna Bos said. “Don’t do this on your own; speak to your relatives about it if you are planning this,” she told the Volkskrant.</p><p>Critics, among whom former NVVE director Petra de Jonge, have called the method “barbaric” and “medieval” for healthy people and only acceptable for the very old and weak.</p><h2>Right support</h2><p>The organisation has since accepted that starvation can lead to a dignified death but only with the right support. Van ter Beek said. “Without that, it can be horrendous,” she said.</p><p>The fact that people turn to starvation because they are being denied euthanasia is “extremely sad”, she said. “It shouldn’t be necessary. People who have thought about it and want to die would be helped by a doctor or a counselor,” she told the paper.</p><p>Research carried out by the NVVE in 2024 <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2024/11/support-for-completed-life-right-to-die-grows-survey-shows/">showed</a> that over seven in 10 people think the Netherlands should bring in legislation to make it possible to help the frail elderly who feel they have reached the end of their natural lives to die.</p><p><strong><em>Anyone struggling with suicidal thoughts can call or chat anonymously by calling the helpline 113, or 0800-0113 or online at <a href="http://113.nl/">113.nl</a>. </em></strong></p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/euthanasia/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/right-to-die/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/society/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=263578</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 09:48:35 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Hanneke Sanou]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Colder weekend ahead with frost and chance of snow</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/02/colder-weekend-ahead-with-frost-and-chance-of-snow/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-263576 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-snow category-society category-weather"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Colder weekend ahead with frost and chance of snow</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-02-13T08:44:30+00:00"> February 13, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114802" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_114802"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="480" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bike-in-snow.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bike-in-snow.jpg 640w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bike-in-snow-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bike-in-snow-300x225.jpg 300w" width="640"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-114802"> The snow may be back on Sunday.

confrontational” and that much needs to be done to ensure the algorithms are used correctly.</p><p data-end="938" data-start="666">The department uses the algorithm some 44,000 cases a year to help decide whether someone is likely to re-offend, including people being held in jail awaiting trial. The reports are used by judges to determine sentences and to decide whether people should be released from prison early.</p><p data-end="1126" data-start="940">The inspectors’ report shows that the system used by the department gets it wrong 20% of the time and that one of the algorithms, Oxrec, fails to meet the standards for government use.</p><p data-end="1358" data-start="1128">Since 2018, the inspectors said, the Oxrec formulas used to assess people with convictions and suspects had been swapped, drug use was not properly taken into account and serious psychological problems were not included at all.</p><p data-end="1358" data-start="1128"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center

population rather than the Dutch.</p><p data-end="1667" data-start="1479">This means “in most cases the risk of re-offending was estimated to be lower than it was”, the inspectors said, particularly among drug users and people with serious psychological issues.</p><p data-end="1908" data-start="1669">“AI and algorithms make it very attractive not to think, to ask fewer questions and to accept what is offered to us,” Delft University professor Cynthia Liem told Nieuwsuur. “You see this happening a lot with technological applications.”</p><h2 data-end="1908" data-start="1669">Temporary halt</h2><p data-end="2039" data-start="1910">Reclassering Nederland has stopped using the systems and is now looking into the use of risk assessment programmes in its work.</p><p data-end="2398" data-start="2041">Government inspectors say the most serious error made by the system is that the risk of reoffending was under-estimated, which could have endangered society.</p><p data-end="2398" data-start="2041">Westerik said she could not rule out that people had been released from jail too early or given longer sentences because of the system. “But I think the likelihood is very low,” she told Nieuwsuur.</p><p data-end="2762" data-start="2400">In 2020, <a href="https://www.trouw.nl/binnenland/algoritmes-gebruikt-door-reclassering-zorgen-voor-etnisch-profileren~b8918776/">researchers warned the justice ministry</a> about the use of the Oxrec algorithm, saying that the use of postcodes could indirectly lead to ethnic profiling.</p><p data-end="2762" data-start="2400">The department had taken that warning “very seriously”, Westerik said, but added there was sufficient scientific evidence at the time for neighbourhood and income to be considered relevant factors.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100
