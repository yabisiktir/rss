D66 and CDA want to reform the nationality laws so that Dutch nationals who take a second passport no longer lose their citizenship after 13 years.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>The construction sector said it was encouraged by the parties’ plans to deregulate the planning system by removing opportunities to appeal against decisions and simplifying the process of subdividing homes and apartments.</p><p>CDA and D66 also want to set national standards for conservation and sustainability so that builders no longer have to deal with different regulations in each municipality.</p><p>“Speeding up the appeals procedure is something we really need and we particularly appreciate the efforts to scale back regulation and local level, the planned investment in infrastructure and the solutions for the electricity network,” a spokesman for construction industry body Bouwend Nederland said.</p><h2>Nitrogen emissions</h2><p>Farmers’ organisation LTO said it supported the parties’ proposals to cut nitrogen compound emissions by prioritising the most sensitive Natura-2000 conservation areas and replacing the models used to calculate nitrogen pollution with new measures that reflect “the actual state of our nature”.</p><p>D66 and CDA say they will stick to the current target of bringing emissions within legal limits by 2035, with an interim target of 75% of conservation areas by 2030, even though D66 said in its manifesto it wanted to reach 100% by the earlier date.</p><p>The LTO’s stance contrasted with the more critical response by the farmers’ party BoerBurgerBeweging, which called the agreement “bad news for the countryside” and said farmers and fishers would pay the price for “unattainable and unaffordable green ambitions”.</p><p>Employers’ organisations VNO-NCW and the small and medium-sized business lobby MKB Nederland said the plans were infused with “the positive energy the Netherlands needs and rightly focus on the future earning potential of our country”.</p><h2>Alarm bells</h2><p>They singled out CDA and D66’s proposals to invest in sustainable businesses and innovation, as well as funding for lifelong learning and reforms to the dismissal laws and unemployment and incapacity benefits.</p><p>But the two leading Dutch trade unions, FNV and CNV, criticised the reforms to social security. “Reforms are often a euphemism in The Hague for budget cuts and eroding social rights,” the FNV, said, while the CNV said references to modernisation rang “alarm bells”.</p><p>“In practice it often means diluting workers’ rights, even though protection from dismissal and severance pay are well regulated in the Netherlands.”</p><p>The Socialist Party (SP) said it was concerned that the document paved the way for cuts to social security and healthcare to finance more spending on defence. Leader Jimmy Dijk called it a “neoliberal vision that will cause more inequality and polarisation”.</p><p> </p><p> </p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/cda/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/construction/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/d66/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/education/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/election-2025/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/politics/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/universities/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=260686</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 14:26:26 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Gordon Darroch]]></dc:creator></item></channel></rss>
