She has said repeatedly that her party will not join a majority government which includes the left-wing alliance.</p><p>A minority cabinet involving the right-wing VVD and two centre parties would be a risky experiment given the current global instability, as well as cheating the parties that wanted change, Klaver said</p><p>A three-way minority coalition would only have 66 seats in the lower house, 10 short of a majority, and be dependent on support from smaller parties to get its legislation through parliament. It would also only control 22 of the 75 seats in the senate.</p><p>The VVD was keen to have far right party JA21 in the new government but Jetten has rejected that option.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/cda/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/d66/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/election-2025/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/vvd/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=260890</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 17:43:49 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>New rail firm plans services to Berlin, Hamburg and Paris</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/12/new-rail-firm-plans-services-to-berlin-hamburg-and-paris/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-260888 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-business category-dutch-european-news category-eurostar category-trains category-travel"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> New rail firm plans services to Berlin, Hamburg and Paris</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2025-12-08T17:27:46+00:00"> December 8, 2025 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140619" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_140619"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="450" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/railway-track-no-train.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/railway-track-no-train.jpg 600w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/railway-track-no-train-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/railway-track-no-train-93x70.jpg 93w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/railway-track-no-train-130x98.jpg 130w" width="600"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-140619"> Photo: Niels Pluto</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><p>New rail company GoVolta will begin running services from Amsterdam to Berlin and Hamburg in a few months, three years after first launching its plans.</p><p>From late March, the company plans three trains a week to Berlin and three to Hamburg, the company said on Monday.</p><p data-end="654" data-start="354">It will be the first direct daytime rival to NS and Deutsche Bahn, which currently operate seven services a day between the two capitals.

The NS journey is just under six hours.
