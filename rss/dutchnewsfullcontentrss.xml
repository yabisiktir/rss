That was 18 years ago. A three year degree in Maastricht turned into a master’s degree followed by training followed by a lot of other things and I just stayed.</p><p>I remember researching my career options. I thought about what I wanted to do after the bachelor’s, what was a possible master’s, what was a possible job in which country and in which language, and somehow the answers all pointed to the Netherlands.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>How do you describe yourself – an expat, lovepat, immigrant, international?</strong>None of the above. I think I’m too German to be Dutch and too Dutch to be German. People try to place me in a box based on my behaviour, outfit, or accent… and usually fail. So let’s keep it simple: I’m European. Or even better, just human.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>I spent one of my high-school years in New Zealand when I was 16.

That was followed by university in the Netherlands and then I did half a year on Aruba to improve my Dutch skills.</p><p>Whenever you move to a different country, you take something different with you and you pick up new things. You learn, you grow, and you take some part of that language and that culture with you.</p><p><strong>How long do you plan to stay?<br/> </strong>Potentially forever. Time will tell, but for now I genuinely enjoy living here. The Netherlands still feels like the right mix of familiar and foreign in all the best ways.</p><p>And all the adult things for me have happened here; things like buying a house, doing a mortgage, tax declarations, and insurances. If I went to any other country, I would have to learn how to do those all over again. That can be exciting, that can be fun, but it would be a challenge and this feels like home.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p><strong>Do you speak Dutch and how did you learn?<br/> </strong>I do now, yes. My first student job was wrapping presents in a ICI Paris perfume shop during the Christmas rush. I learned exactly one sentence and one sentence only: ‘<em>Is het een Sinterklaas of kerstcadeau</em>?’ [‘is it a Sinterklaas or Christmas present?’]</p><p>I had to wrap all the presents and would say ‘hello’ to each customer before asking them the question and trying to chose the right type of paper. Thankfully, there was a third neutral type I could use when I didn’t understand what they were saying.</p><p>It was really learning by doing and in that type of job people love to talk to you. Customers told me long stories about the weather, their aunt, their dog, why they picked this perfume, and I just smiled and nodded because I didn’t understand a word. Step by step though, I picked up words. It was a paid course in the sense I was learning Dutch and getting paid to do it.</p><p>And I did do one class, but I found it really useless. You learn things like ‘Hi, my name is Sabine and I’m from Germany. My hobbies are…’ It’s not how anyone speaks. So I learned through e-studying and jobs instead. I did a lot of waitressing too, but then I started studying Dutch law, which is quite an upgrade from perfume vocabulary. I learned so many words no normal person would ever use in real life.</p><p><strong>What’s your favourite Dutch thing?<br/> </strong>The<em> borrel</em> for so many random reasons. People here will get together for drinks for anything. Ooh, it’s a birthday. Ooh, it’s nice weather. Ooh, a colleague bought a hamster. It can be absolutely random, but they’ll find a reason to celebrate life, have a drink with people, and have some snacks with that. I like it.</p><p><strong>How Dutch have you become?<br/> </strong>There are very Dutch things about me, but there are things I’ll never ever want to do, accept, or understand. I do bike everywhere, the obvious one, and I do take paracetamol for a few days before daring to call the doctor. That’s the culture here, which is very different from where I come from.</p><p>I also go outside in any type of weather and use the informal form of ‘you’ in Dutch with basically anyone I meet. It’s always the first name approach, whether that’s someone on the street, the CEO of a company, or whoever. There’s no hierarchy in that sense.</p><p>But one thing I still find very weird is this whole birthday thing where you come in and congratulate everyone. If it’s my friend Anna’s birthday, people will congratulate me even though it’s Anna’s birthday. I fail to understand that.</p><p>At a party, you’ll congratulate the parents, and I do get that part. They made the person. That’s great, awesome, but anyone else? A neighbour? A friend? I don’t get it. I won’t do it. I say ‘hi’ and then excuse myself. It’s where I draw the line.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Which three Dutch people (dead or alive) would you most like to meet?</strong></p><p>Cabaretier<strong> Lisa Loeb. </strong>She talks about femicide and she does it in a really confronting and honest kind of way, which I find impressive and important. Topics like these shouldn’t be funny, but the way she exposes society’s blind spots is brilliant.</p><p>Amsterdam mayor<strong> Femke Halsema.</strong> I like people who show integrity in a human kind of way. She’s a politician who doesn’t just go where the wind blows, who actually stands for something, and tries to find connections between people, no matter their background or belief system. She brings nuance and humanity into tough conversations.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Anne Frank. </strong>Her writing still shapes how we understand an entire period of history.<strong> </strong></p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-251949" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_251949" style="width: 560px"><noscript><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-251949" decoding="async" height="420" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0071-560x420.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0071-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0071-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0071-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0071-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0071.jpg 2016w" width="560"/></noscript><img alt="" class="lazyload size-medium wp-image-251949" data-sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" data-src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0071-560x420.jpg" data-srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0071-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0071-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0071-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0071-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0071.jpg 2016w" decoding="async" height="420" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20560%20420%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="560"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-251949">Fenix’s “Suitcase Labyrinth” features 2,000 donated suitcases.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>What’s your top tourist tip?<br/> </strong>They should go to Fenix, the museum of immigration in Rotterdam. It emphasises how everyone is an immigrant. We have this idea that immigrants are either refugees or people who are merely looking for luck. When you go there, you’ll see that everyone’s story, if you go a bit further back, is always all about immigration. People move. It’s part of the DNA of human beings. I really like that. It’s a different perspective and they offer it in a kind of fun way.</p><p>And if they’re already in Rotterdam, they can make a day of it: take a boat across the river, wander through the Markthal, or try one of the many small restaurants that make the city feel so alive.</p><p><strong>Tell us something surprising you’ve found out about the Netherlands.<br/> </strong>Everyone speaks English at a pretty decent level, which makes you think everything here is easy since everyone speaks English, but the moment you need to talk about scary adult things, suddenly it’s no longer possible to speak in English.</p><p>Tax returns, insurances, notary deeds, and court hearings? You suddenly need a Dutch interpreter for things like these that really matter. That language gap is exactly why I started <a href="https://counselr.nl/">Counselr</a>. And, yes, it’s a long road, but someone has to make the legal system more accessible for internationals.</p><p><strong>If you had just 24 hours left in the Netherlands, what would you do?<br/> </strong>One massive, 24 hour straight <em>borrel</em>. Life here is all about the people you meet, right? As much as you might enjoy a city, buildings, nature, or whatever you’re into about the country, at the end of the day, it’s about the people you meet, how they treat you, and how they welcome you. Because I feel at home here, I would want to invite everyone who has crossed my path in the past 18 years and share memories while having a good <em>borrel </em>together.</p><p><em>Visit </em><a

different, and national competences vary across member states,” he said. “To make it work, you have to account for the differences in Europe.”</p><p>The relaxation of state aid rules will make it

and holiday rentals “in areas under housing stress”.</p><p><a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/07/holiday-rentals-plunge-in-amsterdam-but-grow-overall-in-nl/">Short-term rentals across Europe</a> grew by almost 93% between 2018 and 2024, and in popular destinations they now represent 20% of the housing stock, the commission said.</p><p>“We cannot sit back while local citizens are pushed out of the housing market in the places where they were born or where they want to build their life,” energy and housing commissioner Dan Jørgensen said, while announcing the plans in the European parliament.</p><p>“Short term rentals is, as such, not a bad idea,” he said. ‘For some people the income they can get from renting out their homes might be what actually makes it possible for them to stay in their home… but when we see people not being able to live in certain areas of a city because prices have gone up pushed by short term rentals… then, of course, it is a problem”.</p><p>The new rules will address competition between professional hosts with traditional accommodation providers, who have to comply with stricter safety and consumer protection requirements, the commission said.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2023/11/watershed-moment-new-eu-rules-on-airbnb-style-rentals-agreed/">existing EU regulation</a> becoming effective in May 2026 requires the registration of hosts and the sharing of data with national authorities.</p><p><strong>House prices</strong></p><p>Jaume Collboni, mayor of Barcelona and deputy president of Eurocities, the organisation representing cities in Brussels, said the plan “represents a turning point for Europe’s housing crisis.”</p><p>According to the commission analysis, housing demand in the EU is expected to grow by more than two million units per year, mainly in urban areas. One million homes will be needed in the Netherlands by 2031.</p><p>In several European cities essential workers, such as teachers, nurses and police officers, cannot afford to live in the communities where they work and young people are pushed out of the market, the commission noted.</p><p>Only three member states – the Netherlands, Austria and Denmark – have more than 20% of their housing stock classified as social housing. In the Netherlands, the proportion was 34% in 2021 while the EU average is 6-7%.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/construction/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/dutch-european-news/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/house-prices/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/housing/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=261231</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 07:52:46 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Claudia Delpero]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>MPs back legislation to lift ban on growing embryos for research</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/12/mps-back-legislation-to-lift-ban-on-growing-embryos-for-research/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-261228 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-research category-society"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> MPs back legislation to lift ban on growing embryos for research</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2025-12-16T15:54:38+00:00"> December 16, 2025 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-95951" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_95951"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="373" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IVF-fertility-treatment.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IVF-fertility-treatment.jpg 499w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IVF-fertility-treatment-300x224.jpg 300w" width="499"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-95951"> Photo: Depositphotos</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><p>Dutch MPs on Tuesday voted in favour of legislation which will lift the ban on the use of embryos specifically grown for scientific research to improve IVF treatment.</p><p>In total 90 parliamentarians voted for the proposal and 59 were against.
