All laws have to be passed by both houses.</p><h2>Social security</h2><p>Klaver <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2600552-groenlinks-pvda-alleen-steun-aan-coalitieplannen-als-roer-drastisch-omgaat">told the party meeting</a> in Utrecht: “We are going to make sure in parliament that the irresponsible cuts that are being proposed do not go through.”</p><p>But he hinted there was room for compromise, adding: “I am not going to sweeten the pill by saying we will never, ever be able to support spending cuts.”</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div

billion from the security budget during the four-year cabinet term by measures such as introducing contributions for home-based care.</p><p>The excess charge (<em>eigen risico</em>) on compulsory health insurance, which has been frozen at €385 for the last 10 years, will increase to €460 in 2027 and be linked to inflation in future.</p><p>The incoming cabinet, led by Rob Jetten, also wants to make older workers retire later by raising the retirement age in step with life expectancy, rather than by eight months for every projected year.</p><p>GroenLinks-PvdA campaigned during the election to invest in healthcare and social security, including phasing out excess charges for insurance and raising the minimum wage, state pension and other benefits.</p><p>Klaver told party members in Utrecht: “I think we can make savings in healthcare by organising things differently.</p><p>“I have seen too often in politics that when people talk about improving the quality of healthcare, they start by making big cuts and it’s always the most vulnerable people who pay the price, without healthcare getting any better.”</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4
