“the cutting edge of tradition and change”.</p><p>The jury said the programme had established itself in the last 25 years as an “annual benchmark that provides viewers of all ages, whether with or without children, with magic and talking points every day.”</p><p>Previous winners of the award include virologist Marion Koopmans and intensive care specialist Diederik Gommers during the coronavirus pandemic, investigative news bureau Bellingcat, former national men’s football team coach Bert van Marwijk and Queen Máxima.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none

around three weeks leading up to December 5, when St Nicholas traditionally delivers presents to Dutch children by riding across the rooftops on his white horse and entering their houses by the chimney.</p><p>The nightly programme takes the form of a news show with updates on the progress of Sinterklaas, who according to legend arrives from Spain by steamer with his gang of helpers known as Pieten.</p><p>The 10-minute episodes are peppered with topical references: during the pandemic the Pieten held news conferences to announce new rules about the distribution of presents, echoing the government’s lockdown press conferences.</p><h2>Death threats</h2><p>The script changes every year, but the basic elements are always the same: Sinterklaas and his assistants face a series of setbacks and calamities that jeopardise the delivery of the presents, but the problems are always resolved in the nick of time, usually through the wise intervention of the saint.</p><p>Last year’s storyline sparked anger when the “head Piet” (Hoofdpiet), played by Niels van der Laan, said friends and relatives might have to take over the role of Sinterklaas during a national emergency.</p><p>Presenter Merel Westrik said Van der Laan <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2593215-hoofdpiet-niels-van-der-laan-met-de-dood-bedreigd-voor-suggestie-in-sinterklaasjournaal">had received several death threats</a>

also had to respond to the controversy around the blackface character Zwarte Piet, treading a delicate line between traditionalists who were resistant to any change and organisations such as Kick Out Zwarte Piet, which denounced it as a racist caricature.</p><p>While activists on both sides of the debate clashed at the Sinterklaas arrival parades in November, the programme makers opted to let the tradition evolve, gradually replacing blackface Piets with sooty-faced versions between 2014 and 2019.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10

After the United States sank over 20 boats and forcibly boarded several oil tankers, the situation ended in what can only be described as a coup.</p><p>The American army bombed important cities and army bases in Venezuela and kidnapped President Nicolás Maduro. In a subsequent speech, Trump even announced that the United States would “run” Venezuela for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Unease about the situation had been growing in the nearby islands of Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao for some time. The Dutch government has now expressed its concern, but the tone so far has been non-committal and cautious. The Netherlands prefers to watch from the sidelines, it seems.</p><p>That is an odd and even inappropriate stance, seeing that the Netherlands played a key role in promoting foreign nations’ greed for Venezuela’s crude oil and the subsequent interventions by Western nations in the country’s national politics.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>Dutch holiday brochures paint Curaçao as a beach resort, conveniently leaving the steel frame of the oil refinery towering over Willemstad out of the picture. But for a long time, the island was home to one of the biggest oil refineries in the world. Its geographical location enabled the distribution of crude oil from Venezuela to Dutch allies in North America and Europe.</p><p>Until well into the 1970s, Dutch owner Shell made huge profits from the insatiable European and American need for oil and the willingness of Venezuelan politicians to trade oil for power and political support. The American oil refinery founded on  Aruba in 1928 made for even closer ties between the Netherlands and the United States.</p><h2>Protecting the oil industry</h2><p>The two countries often cooperated to safeguard Venezuelan oil reserves, sometimes to the detriment of the region’s population. The oil industry had to be protected and political opposition <a href="https://studythesouth.org/plantation-myths-plantationocene-realities/">suppressed</a> at all costs.</p><p>Before World War II, the Dutch authorities handed over political refugees, including union officials and campaigners for democracy, who had sought sanctuary in Curaçao to escape the Venezuelan regime. Many ended up in barbaric circumstances in prisons or died during forced labour.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>The violence even took place on Dutch colonial soil. In 1929, Venezuelan activist Hilario Montenegro was shot dead in broad daylight on the streets of Willemstad.</p><p>When, in that same year, a coalition of Venezuelan and Curaçaoan activists and oil workers mounted an explosive expedition to oust Venezuelan dictator Juan Vicente Gómez, the Dutch colonial regime sprang into action. Aided and abetted by the United States, the authorities rounded up Venezuelan migrants, who were interrogated and deported without legal recourse.</p><p>Police also questioned locals who had been vocal about the situation, censorship was tightened and independent political associations and meetings were curtailed even further.</p><h2>Chávez victory</h2><p>The election of the left-wing candidate Hugo Chávez in 1999 can be seen partly as a reaction to the prolonged history of intervention and Western hunger for oil. Chávez – Maduro’s predecessor –  promised to end poverty and swore to limit foreign intervention.</p><p>His government supported ongoing attempts to nationalise the oil reserves, and it didn’t come as a surprise that some of the criticism was aimed at The Hague, which, according to the socialist president, was in league with the United States in an ongoing campaign of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/business/energy/venezuela-s-chavez-accuses-dutch-of-aggression-idUSN17191522/">“aggression and intervention”</a>.</p><p>The current situation is not the same as it was a century ago. Shell left the Caribbean in 1985 and the Dutch government is not as closely involved in the recent interventions in Venezuela as it was in the past.</p><p>However, the historic role the Netherlands played in the region should be recognised. The outgoing Dutch government has still not condemned the attack on Venezuela and the abduction of Maduro, both illegal acts, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/business/energy/venezuela-s-chavez-accuses-dutch-of-aggression-idUSN17191522/">human rights experts.</a></p><p>The ABC islands are still home to <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/01/dutch-caribbean-islands-on-alert-after-us-venezuela-strikes/">two American air bases</a>, further strengthening Maduro supporters in their suspicion that the Netherlands is poised for intervention.</p><p>Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao – and not The Hague are being put at risk.
