We have not seen snow like this for a long time.”</p><p>Hundreds of flights have been cancelled at Schiphol airport, stranding tens of thousands of passengers.</p><p>Keeping aircraft free of ice requires specialist equipment and the work is done by office staff who have been trained to do so, he said. “But you never have enough equipment on days like this,” Melkert said.</p><p>“It takes between five and 20 minutes to complete the process but on average there are 1,300 take-offs a day, and there are not hundreds of machines to use.”</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>It is also questionable whether the investment would be worth it, Melkert said. “If you buy more machines, they will have to be maintained all year, and then Schiphol costs rise and plane tickets are already so expensive,” he said. “This is the result – it’s a shame but that’s the way it is.”</p><p>ProRail spokesman Andy Wiemer said the same considerations also apply to the railways. “The Dutch railway network is not built for this sort of weather,” he said. “We’d need billions of euros to change it and you have to ask if it would be worth it for three days every few years.”</p><p>In many places the points – which allow trains to switch tracks – are kept warm by gas and the flame can blow out in strong winds, he said. Electric heating would be more efficient and is used in Switzerland.</p><h2>Six months of snow</h2><p>“But there they have snow for six months a year and have built their infrastructure around it,” Wiemer said. “They spend 5% of their GDP on infrastructure and we spend 1.2%.”</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261865" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_261865" style="width: 560px"><noscript><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-261865" decoding="async" height="420" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0975-560x420.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0975-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0975-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0975-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0975-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0975.jpg 2016w" width="560"/></noscript><img alt="" class="lazyload size-medium wp-image-261865" data-sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" data-src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0975-560x420.jpg" data-srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0975-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0975-1200x900.jpg 1200w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0975-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0975-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0975.jpg 2016w" decoding="async" height="420" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20560%20420%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="560"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-261865">Photo: Heavy snow on Monday evening.
