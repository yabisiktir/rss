That is still open too.” D66 leader Rob Jetten, who is set to be the next prime miniser, has also said he is not keen on forming an alliance with the far-right group, which has just nine seats in parliament.</p><p data-end="838" data-start="596"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1037" data-start="845">A four-party coalition including JA21 would still be one seat short of a majority in the lower house of parliament, with 75 seats, and would also fall well short of a majority in the senate.</p><p data-end="1037" data-start="845">In addition, it would mean D66 would be the most left-leaning party in the coalition.</p><p data-end="1293" data-start="1044">Bontenbal’s remarks come at a decisive moment in the coalition talks.

report outlining the potential impact of a range of <a href="https://www.knmi.nl/over-het-knmi/nieuws/een-extreem-rapport/">severe weather scenarios</a> on the Netherlands, from unprecedented heatwaves to tropical storms and prolonged periods of cold.</p><p data-end="738" data-start="369">The risks themselves are not new, but the report deliberately explores the outer limits of what could realistically occur in the Netherlands. “It is meant to provoke and help us prepare better for crisis situations,” KNMI director general Maarten van Aalst told <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2594227-kou-hitte-stormen-of-duisterluwte-knmi-verkent-weersextremen-die-ons-kunnen-raken">broadcaster NOS</a>.</p><p data-end="1503" data-start="1053">The scenarios include a very severe heatwave, weeks of extreme cold, exceptionally heavy rainfall, large-scale wildfires and extremely low water levels in the Rhine.</p><p data-end="1503" data-start="1053"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative"

style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1503" data-start="1053">Other scenarios involve prolonged grey, windless weather leading to very low wind and solar power generation, a tropical storm tracking towards the Netherlands, and a powerful hurricane hitting Bonaire, Saba or St Eustatius.</p><p data-end="1859" data-start="1505">To construct the scenarios, researchers started with recent extreme events and then introduced small variations into their weather models. Computers ran these models dozens of times to calculate alternative outcomes, each of which is, in principle, equally likely.</p><p data-end="2194" data-start="1861">One scenario is based on the heatwave that hit the Netherlands in July 2018. In reality, it ended after a few days when cooler air and rain arrived. The models showed that this cooling could also have missed the Netherlands entirely. In that case, the heatwave would have lasted another five days.</p><p data-end="2194" data-start="1861"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="2673" data-start="2196">Another scenario looks at tropical storm Kirk, which veered away from the Netherlands in 2024 and instead hit Spain and France. According to the models, the storm could also have reached the North Sea.</p><p data-end="2673" data-start="2196">In that scenario, it would have intensified over the water and then swept across the Netherlands for several hours, with wind speeds of up to 180 kilometres per hour and causing up to €2.7 billion in damage to buildings.</p><p data-end="2673" data-start="2196">The KNMI currently uses the period 1991–2020 as a comparison to today’s weather but since then the Dutch climate it has already warmed by almost one degree, the agency said.</p><p data-end="2673" data-start="2196">“This means that weather extremes – which often intensify more strongly than the average – are already markedly different from those of that period,” the KNMI said. “What was once virtually impossible, such as temperatures of 40° in the Netherlands, is now something we need to take into account.”</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/environment/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/society/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/weather/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=261105</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 14:23:12 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Hard cheese: best Gouda in the world is made in Belgium</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/12/hard-cheese-best-gouda-in-the-world-is-made-in-belgium/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-261084 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-belgium category-cheese category-food-industry newsletter-include"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Hard cheese: best Gouda in the world is made in Belgium</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2025-12-12T11:53:13+00:00"> December 12, 2025 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140670" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_140670"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="568" sizes="(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Kaasmarkt_Gouda.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Kaasmarkt_Gouda.jpg 820w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Kaasmarkt_Gouda-560x388.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Kaasmarkt_Gouda-768x532.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Kaasmarkt_Gouda-640x443.jpg 640w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Kaasmarkt_Gouda-100x70.jpg 100w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Kaasmarkt_Gouda-130x90.jpg 130w" width="820"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-140670"> The tourist's view of Gouda.
