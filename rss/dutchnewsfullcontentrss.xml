Shortly before kick-off on Wednesday evening AFCA, the second largest Ajax supporters’ club, <a href="https://afcasc.nl/tijd-voor-een-nieuwe-trainer-met-ervaring/">released a statement</a> calling for Heitinga to be replaced.</p><p>Ten Hag, who led Ajax to the semi-final of the Champions League in 2019, is a free agent after being sacked by Bayer Leverkusen in August just three matches into his reign, though he has also been <a href="https://talksport.com/football/3702905/rob-edwards-next-wolves-manager-erik-ten-hag/">linked to the vacant manager’s job at English Premier League club Wolverhampton Wanderers</a>.</p><p>Heitinga has been at the helm since Francesco Farioli’s abrupt departure at the end of last season, but fans see his lack of experience as a first-team coach – he was previously assistant to Arne Slot at Liverpool – as evidence that the club lacks ambition.</p><h2>“Huge respect”</h2><p>AFCA said it had “huge respect for Johnny Heitinga as a player”, referring to the seven years he spent as a defender at the club between 2001 and 2008. “But we are judging him now as the coach of the Ajax first team,” they said.</p><p>“After 11 league matches, eight points behind [Feyenoord and PSV in the Eredivisie], the miserable performances in the Champions League and a style of football that’s enough to make you weep, the only conclusion we can come to is that Johnny is not the right head coach for Ajax.
