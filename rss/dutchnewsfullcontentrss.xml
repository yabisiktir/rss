In 2017, the way this ground was valued was changed and leaseholders were given a choice to do nothing, pay off their lease or switch to a more expensive, permanent <em>eeuwigdurende</em> annual ground rent.</p><p>Now, however, the local CDA party believes that the council did not explain in a <a href="https://www.tias.edu/artikelen/grondwaardecommissie-pleit-eenvoud-amsterdamse-erfpacht">crystal clear way</a> what would happen if home owners who are liable for ground rent did nothing.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>At the end of their 50-year lease period, the council now reassesses the ground rent using a system that puts up annual payments by far more than the rise in house prices – the <a href="https://centaur.reading.ac.uk/55567/1/wp0116.pdf">discredited</a> “residual method”, <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/698cb666bb6023ea0f7123d5/Policy_statement_on_ground_rents.pdf">previously used</a> by developers in England.</p><p>“It is a complex financial product,” said CDA councillor Laurens Lochtenberg. “Most people don’t understand. This especially affects those with a lower level of education and internationals who don’t have mastery of the language. The ruling is like saying that next to your mortgage, the ground loan is €80,000…but if you don’t do anything, it will go up to €400,000.”</p><h2><strong>Unaffordable</strong></h2><p>Dutch papers have reported a case in Amsterdam where an 87-year-old leaseholder’s ground rent will go from <a href="https://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/van-315-euro-naar-35-000-euro-erfpacht-per-jaar-henk-raaff-stapte-niet-over-en-krijgt-nu-de-rekening-gepresenteerd-voelt-als-een-boete~b94aa17b/">€315 a year to €35,000</a> because he did not make the switch in time.</p><p>In Rotterdam, the head of housing Chantal Zeegers <a href="https://www.rijnmond.nl/nieuws/2101422/na-kritiek-op-hoge-erfpacht-komt-rotterdam-met-korting-voor-huiseigenaren">has announced that</a> she will lower ground rents and lease purchasing costs for around 25,000 leasehold houses because the new rates are unaffordable. In October, Rotterdam announced <a href="https://persberichtenrotterdam.nl/persberichten/kopen-erfpachtgrond-onder-woning-wordt-flink-goedkoper/">a policy to restrict ground values</a>.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>But in Amsterdam, where there are around 160,000 <a href="https://erfpachtinamsterdam.nl/archief/2025-11-04%20Beantwoordingraadsadres%20SEBA.pdf">leaseholders on council land</a>, the CDA is campaigning to allow them all to switch to permanent annual ground rent – because this option has been closed. It wants the offer to be resent, signed post, in “simple and clear” English as well as in Dutch.</p><p>Lochtenberg said if he wants to invest in stocks via his bank, he has to take a course to prove that he understands the risks – but he believes that with leasehold products, Amsterdam council may have breached fair trading and compliance obligations. He has also raised questions about whether the council made <a href="https://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/amsterdamse-huizenbezitters-betaalden-mogelijk-veel-te-veel-erfpachtkosten-door-fout-dit-is-een-smoking-gun/128271778.html">mistakes in calculating ground values</a>.</p><p>Consumer protection body <a href="https://www.erfpachtinamsterdam.nl/archief/2021-11-10_Raadsinformatiebrief%20spijtoptantenregeling%20overstap.pdf">the ACM has said</a> that Amsterdam council was probably “not clear enough” in explaining that it would multiply ground values to make a much greater sum if leaseholders did not pay off their lease or move voluntarily to the new permanent rent.</p><h2>Report</h2><p>A <a href="https://openresearch.amsterdam/nl/page/75106/raadsonderzoek-erfpachtbeleid-amsterdam">report in 2022</a> found that the city did not use open data in calculating street values, so residents could not check their home’s calculations, made “arbitrary choices” in its sums and charged much higher levies than banks use to reduce “the risk that consumers can no longer pay their mortgages”. The multiplier effect was not “clearly and explicitly” communicated, it said.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>In addition, says Lochtenberg, in the group that did not switch, “[almost] <a href="https://amsterdam.raadsinformatie.nl/document/14105400/1">40% of people</a> said they did not get the letter, 40% did not understand it and 6% didn’t have the money to pay for a lawyer.”</p><p>Every year, he claims, some of them are now faced with extreme rises in ground rents, because property prices in Amsterdam have <a href="https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/cijfers/detail/83906NED">doubled in the past decade</a>. “I get letters with people saying that they cannot sleep at night,” he said.</p><p>The CDA has calculated that in the next seven years, around 10,000 leaseholders will be forced to switch to the “residual method” valuation – especially in Nieuw-West, Zuidoost and Noord.</p><h2><strong>“All Dutch”</strong></h2><p>In <a href="https://amsterdam.raadsinformatie.nl/document/14105400/1">city research from 2023</a>, one international is quoted as being totally confused. “All information is in Dutch without translation,” she said. “The first letter dates back to 2020. Even though I immediately applied, it took three years before we received another letter.</p><p>“I again immediately applied on the website, and now it is on hold until an undefined date. We have never received any estimate of what we will have to pay.”</p><p>Opposition party the VVD also disagrees with the system, because many homes that are built on their “own land” do not pay anything, and ground rents vary from hundreds of euros to thousands, depending on when leasehold property was built.</p><p>“The left of the city council wants to keep the system because it brings in a lot of money, but it’s an unfair, unbalanced system,” said Daan Wijnants, head of the local VVD.</p><p>The CDA, VVD and JA21 have proposed <a href="https://amsterdam.raadsinformatie.nl/document/16597462/1/Gemeenteraad+Voordracht?connection_type=1&amp;connection_id=10046133">new bylaws to protect consumer rights</a> in leasehold agreements, which will be discussed at a council meeting on Wednesday 18.

But starting a business in the Netherlands begins with a key decision: choosing the right legal structure for your fledgling company.</strong></p><p data-end="410" data-start="72">If you have been thinking of <a href="https://netherbridge.nl/">setting up a business in the Netherlands</a>, the first thing you need to do is decide what sort of company to launch. The Netherlands has a number of different corporate legal structures and much depends on whether you plan to be self-employed, take on staff or have ambitions to grow into a multinational.</p><p data-end="728" data-start="412">The type of company you opt for will determine more than just the paperwork, says Rasim Kazimov, managing partner and co-founder of corporate service provider <a href="https://netherbridge.nl/">NetherBridge Partners</a>, which helps new and established firms start and expand their operations in the Netherlands.</p><p data-end="728" data-start="412">“If you are <a href="https://netherbridge.nl/corporate/netherlands-company-formation/">setting up a company</a>, you need to have a <a href="https://netherbridge.nl/professional-bookkeeping-dutch-company/">professional accountant</a>, you need to pay your bills and you need to <a href="https://netherbridge.nl/corporate/tax-compliance/">file your taxes</a>,” he says. “The type of company you set up determines liability, taxation, governance and even how investors perceive your business,” he says. “So you need to be careful in figuring out what the best legal structure is for you.”</p><h2 data-end="728" data-start="412"><b>Dutch limited liability company or BV</b></h2><p data-end="1175" data-start="949">The most <a href="https://netherbridge.nl/dutch-business-structures-bv-nv-vof/">popular form for a Dutch company</a> is the BV, or <em>besloten vennootschap</em> – the Dutch limited liability company. A BV is a private limited company with its capital divided into shares which are not usually publicly traded.</p><p data-end="1502" data-start="1177">You can set up a BV for a minimum investment of just one cent per share, which means you do not need a huge amount of starting capital. You are not personally liable for debts apart from your investment, you can have as few as one director and you will pay corporate tax of 19% on profits up to €200,000 and 25.8% above that.</p><p data-end="1696" data-start="1504">A BV, says Rasim, offers “flexibility, limited liability and credibility”. It is, he says, the most straightforward vehicle if you’re setting up a Dutch subsidiary of a foreign parent company or are starting out big.</p><h2 data-end="1696" data-start="1504">Planning to go public?</h2><p data-end="2057" data-start="1698">The NV, or <em>naamloze vennootschap</em>, is the Dutch equivalent of a public limited company or PLC. As a public company, its shares can be listed on the stock exchange, you need minimum share capital of €45,000 and a board of directors. Larger NVs also require a supervisory board. Tax-wise, you pay the same rates as a BV but face stricter reporting requirements.</p><p data-end="2481" data-start="2209">If you are looking to start a small business with a partner, you could opt for a VOF, or <em>vennootschap onder firma</em>, which is a classic partnership structure. A VOF requires no minimum capital, partners are jointly liable for debts and profits are taxed as personal income.</p><p data-end="2681" data-start="2483">A VOF, says Rasim, makes sense for small, low-risk businesses where trust between partners is strong. “It’s easy and cheap to set up, but the liability risks make it unsuitable for larger ventures.”</p><h2 data-end="2681" data-start="2483">The<em> eenmanszaak</em></h2><p data-end="3134" data-start="2683">If you’re a freelancer or running a one-person business, an <em>eenmanszaak</em>, or sole trader business, could be an option. As a sole trader, you are the only owner but you can employ staff if you wish.</p><p data-end="3134" data-start="2683">You will, however, be fully liable for debts and any profit will be taxed as personal income. There are some tax credits for sole traders, although these are being reduced or phased out, but the structure is still often the best option for freelancers and people who are just putting a toe in the water.</p><h2 data-end="3134" data-start="2683">The CV</h2><p data-end="3550" data-start="3136">The CV (<em>commanditaire vennootschap</em>), or limited partnership, is similar to a VOF but with two kinds of partners: general partners, who manage the business and carry unlimited liability, and limited partners (<em>commanditaire vennoten</em>), who contribute capital but are not involved in day-to-day management.</p><p data-end="3550" data-start="3136">CVs are most commonly used for investment vehicles or joint ventures where you want passive investors on board.</p><p data-end="3727" data-start="3552">Other options include the foundation, or <em>stichting</em>, and the cooperative, but these have specific characteristics which are not suitable for most forms of commercial activity.</p><p data-end="4025" data-start="3729">It may seem straightforward at first glance, but each decision carries tax, legal and financial consequences,” says Rasim. “Choosing the wrong structure can result in unnecessary tax exposure or even personal liability. That is why obtaining proper professional advice before you begin is essential.”</p><p>“And we can always find a solution for every client’s problems.”</p><p data-end="4210" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="" data-start="4027"><em><a href="https://netherbridge.nl/">NetherBridge Partners</a> advises companies on every aspect of establishing and operating a business in the Netherlands, from company formation and legal structuring to accounting, tax compliance and strategy.
