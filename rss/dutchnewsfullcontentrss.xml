href="https://news.klm.com/klm-to-accelerate-transformation/">management shake-up</a> that will see chief operating officer Maarten Stienen leave the company.</p><p data-end="296" data-start="0">Chief executive Marjan Rintel, who has been at the helm for four years, has been given more a second four-year period to turn the airline around, KLM said in a <a href="https://www.airfranceklm.com/en/newsroom/air-france-klm-renews-marjan-rintels-mandate-president-ceo-klm">statement</a> issued on Monday evening.</p><p data-end="735" data-start="298">The changes

data-end="735" data-start="298">Rintel said KLM would take steps to simplify the organisation, improve operations, boost revenues and cut costs, adding that she would take more direct control of day-to-day operations alongside the management team.</p><p data-end="735" data-start="298">The shake-up comes the wake of a disastrous first month of 2026, in which KLM services were disrupted by wintry weather and management faced criticism of the way they had handled the cancellations and delays which affected thousands of passengers.</p><p data-end="735" data-start="298">The disruption is

stepping up its support for the Dutch airline and will push for additional synergies, group chief executive Ben Smith said.</p><p data-end="1075" data-start="737">He warned in November that further intervention could follow after third-quarter results showed that an ongoing €450 million cost-cutting programme was failing to deliver sufficient results. Air France-KLM shares have fallen by almost 8% since the start of the year.</p><p data-end="1735" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="" data-start="1202">Trade union De Unie said the group’s Paris headquarters was tightening its grip “with an even tougher mandate” and warned that staff were likely to pay the price.</p><h2 data-end="1735" data-start="1202">Snow</h2><p>Meanwhile, union FNV Luchtvaart polled 190 people who worked at Schiphol during the disruption and three in 10 reported they had been threatened by travellers.</p><p>Workers also complained about the lack of support from management, some of whom “did not show their faces for five days”.</p><p>“Some people did not dare go home in their uniform because they were worried someone would attack them in the far park,” front desk worker Nicole van Unen told the AD.</p><p>KLM is currently carrying out its own evaluation of the chaos. In total, over 3,200 flights were cancelled at Schiphol, leaving 300,000 passengers stranded.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/airlines/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/amsterdam/schiphol/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/unions/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=263100</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 08:01:51 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>Work is only just starting now for the new Dutch government</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/02/work-is-only-just-starting-now-for-the-new-dutch-government/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-263096 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-politics"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> Work is only just starting now for the new Dutch government</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-02-02T16:45:33+00:00"> February 2, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-109366" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_109366"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="750" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pile-of-newspapers.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pile-of-newspapers.jpg 1000w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pile-of-newspapers-560x420.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pile-of-newspapers-768x576.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pile-of-newspapers-300x225.jpg 300w" width="1000"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-109366"> Detail of a pile of international newspapers</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><p data-end="388" data-start="149"><strong>The three parties forming a new coalition – D66, VVD and CDA – published their <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/01/the-new-governments-plans-a-round-up-of-the-main-points/">formal agreement</a> on Friday, but the Dutch papers see a long way to go before their plans make it onto the statute books.

National climate policy is thin, the paper argues, with an emphasis on subsidies, carbon capture and storage and plans for “at least four” new nuclear power stations — all VVD and CDA priorities. Measures such as a national CO₂ levy for industry and stricter targets have been dropped.</p><p data-end="1365" data-start="1013">On migration and nitrogen policy, the paper argues that D66 again moved towards its partners, accepting tougher asylum policies and weaker nitrogen targets and timelines. D66 gains, according to the Volkskrant, are limited, with the agreement containing only “relatively small amounts” for education, the rule of law, media and development cooperation.</p><p data-end="1365" data-start="1013"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="2778" data-start="2439">According to the <a href="https://fd.nl/politiek/1585262/voor-de-oppositie-moeten-de-onderhandelingen-nog-beginnen">Financieele Dagblad,</a> “the negotiations are only just beginning” for the opposition parties that will be needed to steer new legislation through parliament. The coalition agreement, the FD says, can be seen as an opening bid, with key opposition parties already positioning themselves ahead of talks on individual measures.</p><p data-end="3166" data-start="2780">GroenLinks-PvdA leader <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/02/klaver-demands-drastic-changes-to-coalitions-spending-cuts/">Jesse Klaver has called the deal</a> “the starting point for negotiations” and insisted that his party will only offer support in return for a “fundamental change of course”. He was particularly critical of planned cuts to healthcare and social security and of the decision to speed up the rise in the state pension age, which he said undermines long-term agreements.</p><p data-end="3414" data-start="3168">The paper says the minority cabinet will have to rely heavily on deal-making in parliament and points to a central role for CDA leader Henri Bontenbal, who is staying on as parliamentary leader, where much of the political wrangling will be done.</p><h2 data-end="3414" data-start="3168">Coalition resistance</h2><p data-end="3758" data-start="3416"><a href="https://www.telegraaf.nl/politiek/oppositie-slijpt-de-messen-breed-verzet-tegen-bezuinigingen-nieuw-kabinet/128059486.html">The Telegraaf</a> focuses on mounting resistance to the coalition’s cuts, saying the opposition is “sharpening its knives” ahead of the parliamentary debate on Tuesday. During that debate, parties will try to establish whether there is any appetite to back measures such as a faster rise in the state pension age or cuts to unemployment benefits.</p><p data-end="4132" data-start="3760">Klaver has already said he wants to see a “fundamental change of course”, and other parties have also flagged their own red lines, the paper says. The BBB, for example, opposes cuts to healthcare and parts of the climate and nitrogen strategy, while several parties, including the ChristenUnie, see the pension age increase as a major problem.</p><p data-end="4428" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="" data-start="4134">The Telegraaf also reports that opposition parties are trying to avoid being played off against each other. Jan Struijs, leader of the one-man party 50Plus, says that “finding friends and forming coalitions will be our core business”, and the paper concludes that the real test will come later when the coalition’s first budget is published in September.</p><p data-end="4428" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="" data-start="4134">MPs will debate the coalition agreement on Tuesday, with Klaver, as leader of the biggest opposition party, kicking off the proceedings.</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/politics/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=263096</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:45:33 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robin Pascoe]]></dc:creator></item><item><title>January snow caused record number of train delays in Netherlands</title><link>https://www.dutchnews.nl/2026/02/january-snow-caused-record-number-of-train-delays-in-netherlands/</link><description><![CDATA[<article class="post-263093 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-society category-trains category-transport"><header class="pb-4 px-4"><h1 class="text-serif lh-1"> January snow caused record number of train delays in Netherlands</h1> <time class="text-secondary updated me-2" datetime="2026-02-02T16:00:26+00:00"> February 2, 2026 </time></header><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-227812" class="px-lg-5" id="attachment_227812"> <img alt="" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="666" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Depositphotos_17196987_S.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Depositphotos_17196987_S.jpg 1000w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Depositphotos_17196987_S-560x373.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Depositphotos_17196987_S-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Depositphotos_17196987_S-768x511.jpg 768w" width="1000"/><figcaption class="px-4 px-lg-0" id="caption-attachment-227812"> Photo: Depositphotos.com</figcaption></figure><main class="px-4"><p>January’s cold snap led to a record number of problems on the Dutch railway network, with more than 700 faults reported over the course of the month.</p><p>The number of weather-related faults was 68, nearly three times as many as the previous record of 25 in November 2013, according to figures compiled by website <a href="https://www.rijdendetreinen.nl/">rijdendetreinen.nl.</a></p><p>Most of the problems were in the first week of January, when heavy snow and ice caused huge delays on the roads and railways, particularly in the north and east of the country.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>The biggest impact on the railway network was in the west, with Rotterdam Centraal, Leiden Centraal and Schiphol Airport worst hit.
