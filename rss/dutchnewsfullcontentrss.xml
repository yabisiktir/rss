He told ANP: “The text of the new panel makes no mention whatsoever of segregation in the US Army. In that sense the image has been sanitised or whitewashed.”</p><p>Stichting Black Liberators, a Dutch foundation that commemorates the Black American soldiers who served in the Netherlands, said the panel was “a step in the right direction” but it would continue to work to highlight “a painful aspect of history for both the veterans themselves and their relatives who should never be forgotten.”</p><h2>Trump DEI order</h2><p>Referring to the criticism, Popolo said: “It kind of hurt inside that the very, very important work that this cemetery has done has been misconstrued in some respects and frankly hijacked away from the purpose.”</p><p>The previous panel was removed in March shortly after US president Donald Trump issued an executive order, titled Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History, calling for public monuments to be purged of the “corrosive ideology” that presented American history as “inherently racist, sexist, oppressive, or otherwise irredeemably flawed”.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p>The panel <a href="https://blackliberators.nl/stories/margraten">was titled “Fighting on Two Fronts”</a> and included a quote from staff sergeant Jefferson Wiggins, who was 19 at the time, describing how his comrades “cried when they were digging the graves … they were just completely traumatised.” It also described how segregation was abolished by President Truman after the war, in 1948.</p><p>The ABMC later said the panel would not be restored because it did not fit with its “commemorative mission”, despite calls from politicians in Limburg and relatives of fallen Black soldiers in the US to give ”permanent attention” to the story of the Black Liberators.</p><h2>Omissions</h2><p>At a press conference to unveil the new panel, the ABMC’s executive director, Thomas Spoehr, said the previous panel contained “omissions” that ”unintentionally excluded significant contributions to the temporary cemetery.”</p><p>Referring to the struggle against segregation, Spoehr said: “A visitor centre at the cemetery is not a general history museum. Our job in that visitor centre is to tell the stories of the soldiers and the sacrifices that they made.</p><p>“While racism and segregation is an important topic and one that needs to be talked about, it’s not part of the mission of the AMBC.”</p><p>Spoehr argued that the new panel was “more inclusive” because it referred to everyone involved in building the cemetery, including local Dutch citizens who helped out using tools from their farms.</p><h2>“Partial fix”</h2><p>Samuel de Korte, a Dutch writer specialising in Black American war history, described the new panel as a “partial fix” that failed to inform the public about the “core problem” of segregation and racism in the US Army.</p><p>”Black soldiers here fought a two‑front war: against Nazism and against Jim Crow,” he said. “As long as the story at Margraten omits that second front, the history remains incomplete and risks becoming a sanitized version that comforts us rather than tells the truth.”</p><p>As well as the gravediggers’ panel, nine panels have been added to the displays featuring the stories of individual service members, creating 24 in total that will be shown on rotation.</p><p>They include Private Richard Willoughby, from North Carolina, who was killed in action during the capture of the German town of Hann Münden, near Göttingen, on April 7, just before his 21st birthday.</p><p>Spoehr said Willoughby was one of more than 2,000 soldiers in segregated units who were drafted into the infantry during the campaign to liberate Europe in 1944.</p><h2>New faces</h2><p>Among the other new faces is Caswell Taylor, a private first class from Illinois, who was killed in a road collision a month before the liberation, while working on construction and water systems installations.</p><p>Private Jacob T. Herman Jr., native of the Ogala Sioux Tribe, was a 19-year-old paratrooper who died during Operation Market Garden, the failed attempt to liberate Arnhem in September 1944, while Christine A Gasvoda, one of four women buried at the cemetery, was a nurse who was killed in a plane crash during a resupply and evacuation mission.</p><p>Altogether 8,300 service members are buried at Margraten, including 172 Black Liberators, while another 1,700 names are inscribed on the Wall of the Missing.

European competition this week and the games could prove decisive for the Netherlands’ position on the Uefa coefficient ranking.</p><p data-end="613" data-start="345">The Netherlands is in danger of losing its sixth place on the coefficient list to Portugal which will have direct consequences for the number of European places available to Dutch clubs in 2027.</p><p data-end="920" data-start="615">The Netherlands is still benefiting from an exceptionally strong coefficient season in 2021/22, when Feyenoord reached the Conference League final and Ajax won all their Champions League group matches.</p><p data-end="920" data-start="615"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex

which the coefficient ranking is based.</p><p data-end="1542" data-start="1209">The coefficient list determines how many clubs each country may enter into European competitions. The higher a country ranks, the more places it receives. England, Spain, Germany and Italy each have four Champions League spots. The Netherlands currently has two direct Champions League tickets and one place in the qualifying rounds.</p><p data-end="1950" data-start="1544">If the Netherlands drops to seventh, it will lose one direct Champions League spot and the total number of Dutch clubs playing European football would also fall from six to five.</p><p data-end="1950" data-start="1544">At the start of this season, data models gave the Netherlands a 79% chance of holding on to sixth place. After weak performances by Dutch teams and strong results from Portuguese clubs, that probability has now fallen to just 5.5%, <a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2599850-coefficientenweek-van-de-waarheid-voor-nederlandse-clubs-met-portugal-hijgend-in-de-nek">broadcaster NOS reported</a>.</p><p data-end="1950" data-start="1544"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="2499" data-start="2187">There is, however, still a slim chance of a turnaround this week. PSV play at home against Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday. Bayern are already assured of a top-eight finish, raising hopes in Eindhoven that the German side may rest key players, improving PSV’s chances of a win and progression.</p><p data-end="2800" data-start="2501">Ajax host Olympiakos at the same time. Even with a victory, the Amsterdam side will not be guaranteed a place in the next round and will need other results to go their way. A defeat for Benfica by Real Madrid would help, as the Portuguese club is a direct competitor on the coefficient ranking.</p><h2 data-end="2800" data-start="2501">Action this week</h2><p data-end="3064" data-start="2802">Dutch clubs in the Europa League are in action on Thursday. Feyenoord travel to Real Betis, who remain firmly in contention for a top-eight finish. Go Ahead Eagles face Sporting Braga and could boost both their own prospects and the Dutch coefficient with a win.</p><p data-end="3215" data-start="3066">Even then, qualification remains unlikely. Data models give Feyenoord a 12.1% chance of reaching the next round, while Go Ahead Eagles stand at 3.8%.</p><p data-end="3394" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="" data-start="3217">FC Utrecht have an away match against Celtic.
