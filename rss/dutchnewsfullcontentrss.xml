The job of local councillor is a part time position.</p><p data-end="1154" data-start="924">Of the nearly 8,500 councillors elected in 2022, more than 1,250 have already quit local politics, while about 1,000 others have become aldermen or mayors. Most departures occurred around the halfway point of the four-year term.</p><p data-end="1539" data-start="1156">Almost half of those who left cited personal reasons, often linked to the difficulty of combining council work with a job or family life.

The park’s Port Laguna has been turned into ‘Winter Laguna’ and currently boasts an ice rink, various holiday food and beverage specialities, and thousands of twinkling lights.</p><p><strong>Retreat to the couch </strong><strong> </strong></p><p>If trying to find a holiday movie on one of the streamers is too much of a bother, switch over to RTL 8. Believe it or not, the network’s annual cheesy <a href="https://www.rtl.nl/tv/artikel/5529494/rtl-films-november-2025">Christmas rom-com melee</a> kicked off during the first week of November this year!</p><p>They’re now in the middle of rolling out an epic batch of 200 films this holiday season, 80 of which are Dutch TV premieres. The madness truly begins on the 24th when the station’s programmers will push the play button on a nonstop marathon of these festive flicks for 48 hours.</p><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><p><strong>Magical memories in Maastricht</strong><strong> </strong></p><p>The holidays have taken over the centre of Maastricht. Set sail for the Vrijthof where you’ll find a Christmas market, a new 45 metre-tall Ferris wheel complete with enclosed glass gondolas, and one of the nation’s largest ice rinks. This is all part of the city’s annual <a href="https://www.magischmaastrichtvrijthof.nl/">Magisch Maastricht Vrijthof</a>, which will wrap up on December 29.</p><p><strong>Christmas World 2025 </strong><strong> </strong></p><p>We think Intratuin remains pretty much the best place to head for Christmas decorations. The average location has everything from ice cycle lights to wintry cocoa stands that would look perfect in a miniature winter display.</p><p>But the chain’s crème de la crème is <a href="https://www.intratuinduiven.nl/christmas-world-2025/">Christmas World</a> at its Duiven branch, which has been described as the country’s biggest ‘Christmas village.’ It even has its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq9xGQNtaj4&amp;t=114s">own trailer</a>. This time around, Christmas World will close up shop on January 4.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-261129" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_261129" style="width: 560px"><noscript><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-261129" decoding="async" height="374" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-544746616-560x374.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-544746616-560x374.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-544746616-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-544746616-768x512.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-544746616.jpg 1000w" width="560"/></noscript><img alt="" class="lazyload size-medium wp-image-261129" data-sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" data-src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-544746616-560x374.jpg" data-srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-544746616-560x374.jpg 560w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-544746616-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-544746616-768x512.jpg 768w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ANP-544746616.jpg 1000w" decoding="async" height="374" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20560%20374%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="560"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-261129">This is the 70th anniversary of Gouda’s Christmas lights display.

They’ve also been filling arenas around the country for over a decade with a shifting line-up and attracting scores of fans who love to sing along as they roll through set lists comprised of beloved originals and covers.</p><p>They’re taking up residency at Rotterdam Ahoy this holiday season for a series of Christmas concerts between December 18 and 24. If this sounds like your sort of thing, <a href="https://www.toppersinconcert.nl/home">click here</a> for the details.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Wrap up with 2025 with a bang</strong></p><p>If you haven’t heard, the Dutch government will be ringing in the New Year with a <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/2025/07/senate-backs-nationwide-consumer-fireworks-ban-at-new-year/">nationwide fireworks ban</a> in 2026 so this is the last year that consumers will be able to buy all but the gentlest of fireworks – legally at least.</p><p>In the meantime, there are more organised shows, the biggest of which is the annual <a href="https://hetnationalevuurwerk.nl/">Rotterdam fireworks show</a> on the Erasmus Bridge. There are a few changes this year. The music will kick off earlier than usual at 22:30 and there will be more video screens.<strong> </strong></p><p>In Amsterdam, the <a href="https://electricfireworks.nl/">Electric Fireworks</a> event will once again invade the Museumplein. That one kicks off at 10 pm, but it’s popular and space is limited, even if the display itself last year was disappointing.</p><p><em>Looking for more ways to get out and about this holiday season?
