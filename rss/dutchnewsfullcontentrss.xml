Over 10,000 incidents involving fake officers have been registered so far in 2025.</p><p data-end="610" data-start="319">The phenomenon was rare until 2023 but there has since been a sharp increase in both reported incidents and arrests, Nu.nl said. This year’s arrests involve people who turned up at victims’ homes as well as those working from call centres. In 2024 there were 357 arrests, compared with just 127 in 2023.</p><p data-end="801" data-start="612">Police say the high number of arrests reflects the “exponential rise” in cases but also targeted investigations.</p><p data-end="1148" data-start="803">The criminals almost always follow the same pattern. They call victims to say there has been a spate of break-ins in the area and offer to collect valuables to keep them “safe”. The aim is to keep the time between the call and the home visit as short as possible so victims do not have the chance to seek advice or reconsider handing over items.</p><p data-end="1148" data-start="803"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Inarticle"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_inarticle-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="1318" data-start="1150">Police spokeswoman Suzanne van de Graaf told Nu.nl the criminals operate in groups.

That is 20 times the number in 2023, when just 520 cases were logged.</p><p data-end="1791" data-start="1548">Van de Graaf said the rise appears to be driven by copycat behaviour and that there is not one large network behind the cases. The increase may also reflect greater public awareness and reporting, she said.</p><p data-end="1791" data-start="1548"><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-none d-md-block"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden p-4 bg-light my-8 d-block d-md-none"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Incontent"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_incontent-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div></p><p data-end="2290" data-start="2083">Meanwhile, a pro forma court hearing will take place on Wednesday in the case of an 80-year-old woman who died in Amsterdam after being robbed by a fake officer in August.

They are held every four years and the next election will be on March 18, 2025. Amsterdam residents vote to elect the 45 members of the city council.

The aldermen and women, also known as deputy mayors, are selected by the city council; the mayor is appointed by the Crown.</p><p>The number of representatives in city councils and district committees is determined by population size. The City of Amsterdam currently has 45 councillors, and there are seven district committees, plus the administrative committee for Weesp.</p><figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-101613" class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_101613" style="width: 500px"><noscript><img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-101613" decoding="async" height="333" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Amsterdam-view-of-Stopera-city-hall.jpg" srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Amsterdam-view-of-Stopera-city-hall.jpg 500w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Amsterdam-view-of-Stopera-city-hall-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Amsterdam-view-of-Stopera-city-hall-300x200.jpg 300w" width="500"/></noscript><img alt="" class="lazyload size-full wp-image-101613" data-sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-src="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Amsterdam-view-of-Stopera-city-hall.jpg" data-srcset="/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Amsterdam-view-of-Stopera-city-hall.jpg 500w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Amsterdam-view-of-Stopera-city-hall-360x240.jpg 360w, /wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Amsterdam-view-of-Stopera-city-hall-300x200.jpg 300w" decoding="async" height="333" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20500%20333%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="500"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-101613">Amsterdam’s city hall seen from the Amstel river.

The meetings of the city council are open to the public and everyone can speak. The council meetings are held in Dutch; non-Dutch speakers can request to speak with an interpreter but this is not always granted.</p><p><strong> </strong>Mayor and deputy mayors</p><p><a href="https://www.amsterdam.nl/en/governance/the-college-of-mayor-and-alderpersons">The municipal executive</a> (<em>college van burgemeester &amp; wethouders</em> – college of mayor and aldermen and women) is responsible for daily operations and policy implementation. There are seven deputy mayors, each with their own portfolio of topics. The mayor chairs both the municipal executive and the city council. The meetings of the municipal executive are not open to the public.</p><p><strong>District committees</strong></p><p>Amsterdam has <a href="https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/explore/neighbourhoods">seven city districts</a> – Centrum, Nieuw-West, Noord, Oost, West, Zuid and Zuidoost – plus the administrative committee for Weesp. Each city district is managed by a district committee.</p><p>The district committees are the link between <a href="https://www.amsterdam.nl/en/districts-neighbourhoods/">local neighbourhoods</a> and the city. The members are residents of the district in question and deal with topics such as greenery and parks, household refuse collection, street design, social issues and local law enforcement.

If councillors send out signals that they are being put under pressure, we can’t let that pass.”</p></main><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-none d-md-block p-4 bg-light mt-8 mb-10 mx-lg-4"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><div class="ad-container overflow-hidden d-block d-md-none bg-light my-8"><div class="bg-light p-lg-2 h-100 w-100 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative" data-tagname="ROS_Native"><div id="div-gpt-ad-dutchnews_ros_native-m" style="display:block;"></div></div></div><footer class="my-8 px-4"><div class="pb-8"></div> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/asylum/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/politics/?list"></a> <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm" href="/category/zeeland/?list"></a></footer><div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"></div></article>]]></description><guid>https://www.dutchnews.nl/?p=260312</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 10:36:14 -0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[Gordon Darroch]]></dc:creator></item></channel></rss>
