Police forces in France, Sweden, Poland, Czechia and Slovenia and European police force Europol echo the Dutch concerns, he said.</p><p>A national ban on all consumer fireworks is set to come into effect next year but Schouten said that will not greatly affect the trade in illegal fireworks.  Police intercepted a shipment of over seven tonnes of illegal fireworks <a

Volunteers are always welcome, but if you’re short on time, why not start a food drive with friends or family, your company or school or sports club?</p><p>The food banks seek non-perishable foodstuff such as pasta and rice, canned veg and fish, oils, soups, cereals, sauces and peanut butters. You can drop them off at your nearest food bank—which sometimes is a box at your local Albert Heijn or Dirk van den Broek<em>.</em> Hoarder bonus: clean out that pantry!
