It’s only 3am, so I’m counting it as yesterday still. 

I know that I’ve been gone for a while. I’m still sick and fatigued all the time. I don’t have the stamina to make my usual detailed posts. This one will also be cutting some corners as well, but not many. 

 
.   

Anyway…

Fifty years ago today, one of the greatest maritime tragedies and mysteries took place. 

The Edmund Fitzgerald was a cargo ship that was caught in an extremely ugly storm on the Great Lakes. After sending a distress signal, all contact was suddenly cut off. The ship had sunk, taking all 29 crew members on board with it. 

She was even the subject of a song by Gordon Lightfoot:  https://youtu.be/FuzTkGyxkYI?si=j2XWS7twKC9SYyJv 

Despite numerous investigations, nobody really knows what happened during the time between the last radio transmission and the sinking. 

There have been many theories ranging from a failure to secure the hatches to a rogue wave suddenly taking it over. I’m not going to be able to answer the question of what happened, because I have no idea myself. 

But I hope that this will be informative to those who don’t know the wreck very well.</div><div><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/QOWP7vI.jpg" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;"></div><div><span></span></div><div>The Edmund Fitzgerald was a cargo ship that typically carried a raw material known as taconite pellets. 

This is less relevant to the sinking of the ship, but for anyone that is curious about taconite pellets: 

Taconite is a low-grade iron ore. It was originally viewed as the iron equivalent of EA-Nasir’s shitty copper, and not used at all. 

However, over time, continuous mining made high grade iron harder and harder to come by. In fact, this scarcity was threatening to end the iron industry. That’s when scientists turned to taconite. 

Through much experimentation, scientists found a way to separate the iron from the taconite to make it usable for steel production. 

The process is a little complicated, but the general steps involved: 

1.) Mining the talconite

2.) Crushing the rock until it’s a fine powder

3.) Using magnetism to separate the iron from the talcite

4.) Rolling this concentrated powder into clay balls the size of a marble

5.) Heat treating these little balls until they are white hot. 

6.) When they cool, they become hard taconite pellets that are loaded onto cargo ships and shipped across the Great Lakes to steel manufacturers to be melted down into steel.</div><div><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/jArydNa.jpg" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;"></div><div><span></span></div><div>This is a blueprint of the SS Edmund Fitzgerald. 

It was the longest of the cargo ships to be sailing at that time. The wheelhouse was at the bow of the ship while the crew’s quarters and dining hall were in the stern next to the engine room. 

The long stretch between the bow and the stern was where the cargo was held. Each container was closed tight with metal levers(?) called “hatchets.” They acted like claws gripping the lids of the holding containers.  

I added a small image with a closeup of the hatchets, and I colored them red to make it more visible.</div><div><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/9A6wcxu.jpg" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;"></div><div><span></span></div><div>I need to add a disclaimer here: I was personally taught that longer cargo ships are now seen as terrible design flaws than they were back then. 

However, I’m beginning to doubt the truthfulness of that statement. Still, this is how it was explained to me: 

A long design allowed them to carry more cargo, but it also made them weaker to rough seas because their middle section made for a stress point. 

The high seas could basically karate chop these ships in half. The long designs also allowed the end of the ship to hit the bottom of the lake between each massive wave. 

When striking the bottom, the force of impact causes that section of the ship to break, and then it sinks.</div><div><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/00hnhxk.jpg" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;"></div><div><span></span></div><div>Like so. One of these scenarios most likely sunk the Edmund Fitzgerald as well, though we don’t know which one. What we DO know are the events leading up to it. We</div><div><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/FjanFaG.jpg" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;"></div><div><span></span></div><div>Here’s a VERY simplified version of what we know for sure. I’m sorry for all of the dots separating the timeline, there’s not a feature for multiple spaces between paragraphs yet. I hate it just as much as you do. 

.

> At 2:30pm on November 9th, 1975, the Edmund Fitzgerald sailed through ugly weather to reach its offload destination. 

. 

> As time went on, the weather got worse, but it wasn’t bad enough for a couple of captains to delay their transport plans, as they had experience sailing rough seas. 

. 

> At an unspecified time, Captain Cooper saw the Fitzgerald sail too close to the shoal near Caribou Island. 

.

> At 3:30 pm, the Edmund Fitzgerald sent out a radio message to the Arthur M. Anderson: 

“Anderson, this is the Fitzgerald. I have a fence rail down, two vents lost or damaged, and a list. I’m checking down. Will you stay by me till I get to Whitefish?”

Cooper asked if he had his pumps going and he said: “Yes. Both of them.” 

Both captains set sail for Whitefish Point, and kept in regular communication about their navigation. This part was uneventful. 

.

> At 5:20pm, Cooper reported his location to have 58 knot winds and gushes of wind that were as high as 70 knots, with tall waves ranging from 18 - 25ft 

.

> 6:55pm - The Arthur M. Anderson is hit with two massive waves. One of these waves is so strong that it temporarily pushes the bow into the water. He would later say this: 

“Then the Anderson just raised up and shook herself off of all that water – barrooff – just like a big dog. Another wave just like the first one or bigger hit us again. I watched those two waves head down the lake towards the Fitzgerald, and I think those were the two that sent her under.”

. 

> Between 6:55pm - 7:10pm, the Anderson keeps losing sight of the Edmund Fitzgerald on their ship’s radar because the waves were so violent that it interfered with the radar system. 

.

> 7:10pm - First Mate Morgan Clark of the Arthur M. Anderson makes one last call to the Captain of the Edmund Fitzgerald. 

Clark: Fitzgerald, this is the Anderson. Have you checked down?

McSorely: Yes, we have.

Clark: Fitzgerald, we are about 10 miles behind you, and gaining about 1 1/2 miles per hour. Fitzgerald, there is a target 19 miles ahead of us. So the target would be 9 miles on ahead of you.

McSorely: “Well, Am I going to clear?

Clark: Yes, he is going to pass to the west of you

McSorely: Well, fine.

Clark: By the way, Fitzgerald, how are you making out with your problems?

McSorely: We are holding our own.

Clark: Okay, fine, I’ll be talking to you later.

. 

> 7:10 - 7:15 - the Edmund Fitzgerald continues to come in and out of the radar’s detection 

. 

> 7:15pm - The Edmund Fitzgerald disappears from the radar for the last time and doesn’t reappear. 

It’s assumed that’s when she sank, taking all 29 crew members on board with her.</div><div><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/yyhO8mR.jpg" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;"></div><div><span></span></div><div>After the weather was safe enough to do a more thorough search of Lake Superior, the wreck site of the Edmund Fitzgerald was finally discovered in May 1976. 

An initial submersible investigation was done from a submersible that was controlled from the surface that took pictures and video. These were their initial findings.</div><div><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/j4Rb2cp.jpg" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;"></div><div><span></span></div><div>I put together some images of the wreckage, though these are from other dives. The images from the first investigation either haven’t been released to the public, or I couldn’t find them.</div><div><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/dGkdgM5.jpg" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;"></div><div><span></span></div><div>This is a drawing of the locations of the bow and stern of the ship. I’ve always wondered what happened to the piece of the middle section that seems to have just disappeared.</div><div><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/C5o9NB8.jpg" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;"></div><div><span></span></div><div>An artist’s rendition of a submersible exploring the wreck site. I couldn’t find their name, which surprised me.</div><div><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/VWvYVWI.jpg" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;"></div><div><span></span></div><div>That report was not received well. The surviving loved ones were angry at the accusations. Other experts felt that this conclusion was just a lazy attempt to close the investigation by blaming the perished crew that can’t defend themselves. 

Since that initial dive, four other dives took place, including one to retrieve the ship’s bell in 1995. 

None of these dives had concrete results, but there was a forensic investigation done in 2018 based off of the footage from the 1994 and 1995 dives. They came to this conclusion about the hatch covers: 

“If the Fitzgerald had failed due to the hatch covers amidships getting blown in, and / or the hull girder breaking, then the condition of the two forward most hatch covers located just behind the pilot house remains unexplained.”</div><div><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/gTP6WqB.jpg" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;"></div><div><span></span></div><div>Aside from failure in the hatch covers, the two main theories are that the ship either struck the bottom of the lake and snapped in half, or she bottomed out.</div><div><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/RcEBWlK.jpg" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;"></div><div><span></span></div><div>I don’t even know how to make a visual for this, because I barely understand it, but it definitely makes sense for an entire domino set of terrible things to come crashing down in such a rapid sinking.</div><div><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/fwqz2YZ.gif" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;"></div><div><span></span></div><div>This was Captain Bernie Cooper’s theory on how the Edmund Fitzgerald sank.</div><div><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/aIWCev0.jpg" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;"></div><div><span></span></div><div>During a dive to the wreck of the Fitzgerald in 1994, the remains of one crew member were discovered near the bow. He was partially dressed in coveralls and wearing a cork lifejacket. 

However, they couldn’t identify him. The surviving families were notified, and they chose to leave the body there. 

Fred Shannon apparently said that the cork life-vest proved that the captain was aware that the ship could possibly sink, but that’s a dumb hypothesis. I’ll get to that in a moment. 

I did see the picture of the body, as well as the documentary where it came from - in a link that has since been deleted. 

I originally avoided it like the plague because the surviving families didn’t want it released - but I decided to view the documentary for more information on the wreck. 

The picture of the body was so blurry, you couldn’t make out anything. It was also distorted by all of the silt that was now floating about due to being disturbed by the divers and submersibles. I couldn’t make out a life vest. All I saw was silt.</div><div><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/X0f91RV.jpg" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;"></div><div><span></span></div><div>Back to the cork life vest… 

This is what happens when you let a retired police officer/business man play pretend as a scientific explorer: they make stupid statements. 

Normally I try to be respectful of people who make mistakes in logic due to an inaccurate understanding of the situation. 

We’ve all come to a wrong conclusion based on misunderstood information at least once in our lives. This time was different, because it was an invasive investigation under false pretenses. 

Fred Shannon was a retired police officer and a businessman. He was never a scientist, or archaeological expert. He had no background in engineering, or anything relevant to the sinking of a ship. 

He provided the submersibles, at the chagrin of the surviving families. 

He went down there, rooted around, found a body, and made sure to get up-close footage of it to publish in a book and documentary, and presented it as him documenting scientific evidence as if he actually understood the results. 

That entire expedition made him seem smarter than he actually was, and his idiotic conclusion that made the life vest a bigger deal that it was is a representation of that. 

The truth: it is maritime protocol to wear a life-vest in bad weather. EVERY sailor on rough seas would do this. 

Wearing a life-vest doesn’t provide any further clues on the sinking. It just means that the crew that was on deck had common sense.</div><div><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/gWatWIo.jpg" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;"></div><div><span></span></div><div>This is just a hypothesis by a random nerd, but I actually think that the reason that there weren’t any other remains found around the ship is because they were in the stern section of the vessel, where the crew’s quarters were.

“Don’t let nobody on deck.” Was heard on the radio, which I think means that the rest of the crew was riding out the storm in the ship, while the captain was still at the wheel house. 

I firmly believe that the set of remains that were discovered were the captain’s. I believe that when the ship sank, he was thrown out of the wheelhouse and then forcefully smashed into the lake floor next to the bow. 

As for the other poor souls, submersibles have checked the living quarters before, but didn’t find anything. However, I haven’t read anything about the engine rooms or the boiler rooms. 

This actually makes me think of the sinking of the RMS Titanic. One of the things that the crew on the Titanic were DESPERATELY trying to prevent was the icy ocean water touching the steaming hot boilers. They knew that when that inevitably happened, it would cause an epic explosion. 

Something that I’ve wondered about is if there was a possibility that a few of the men ran to the boiler room to try to protect it from the incoming cold water. 

This is all conjecture from someone who doesn’t know a damn thing about ships, but I wanted to share my thoughts on it anyway.</div><div><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/rlMKEEH.jpg" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;"></div><div><span></span></div><div>We’ll never know for sure what happened that night. 

Time has almost certainly taken its toll on the ship at this point, and the surviving families of those who perished understandably want the wreck to be left alone. 

It’s unlikely that there will be another authorized expedition to the wreck, and that’s okay. 

I don’t want to come off as shaming grieving people for wanting closure. I would love for there to be another investigation one day to confirm that a failure to secure the hatches wasn’t to blame, but I also understand the desire to just leave it alone at this point. 

My condolences to everyone who lost someone in the Sinking of the Edmund Fitzgerald, and may those who perished that night rest in peace.</div><div><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/JmkA713.jpg" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;"></div><div><span></span></div><div><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/qdrdCMF.jpg" style="max-width: 90%; height: auto;"></div><div><span></span></div><div>Sinking of the Edmund Fitzgerald: https://shipwreckmuseum.com/the-fateful-journey/

Like multiple in a day versus 50 in a week.

I just want to give a heads up as I figure it could annoy the living shit out of some of you. If it goes well, if I can stick with this, some days I might be posting a lot.  and at like all hours of the available day so like 24 hours who knows when I'm going to post but it might be a lot so, yeah.

I want to say that I hope you guys are doing well, but I feel like it would be more appropriate to say that I hope you're finding time to rest. And I hope you have days, or at least a moment that you smile, like really really smile and think about the fact that you're smiling and feel alive and feel grateful that you get to experience that feeling again, and I hope that you can hold on to those moments, and I hope they can get you through.

Cottage Grove, Oregon: ICE Agents Posing as Police Drag Green Card Holder Juanita Avila From Her Car — “You lied to me when you said you were police! Who are you? Why pull me over?” Released only after her daughter confirmed her citizenship**

Juanita Avila, a longtime Cottage Grove resident and local business owner, was detained by ICE agents who allegedly posed as police officers. Video captured by her daughter shows agents dragging Avila from her car and forcing her to the ground. Avila shouted, *“You lied to me when you said you were police! Who are you? Why pull me over?”* during the confrontation.  

Avila, who has lived in the U.S. since age 14 and carries her green card, said she was released only after her daughter proved her legal status. She described the incident as racial profiling, adding that the neighborhood is now fearful of ICE targeting Hispanic residents.

I try to keep my posts "good vibe zones". So, instead of finding the one thing in here you don't like and commenting only on that, also comment about something you DID like. Balance the negativity. Love you long time.

So, I made a discord server. It's a relaxed environment where you can take/donate memes to the cause, play trivia twice a week, chat about lots of topics or about nothing at all. We also have Jack Box game night and are setting up movie night! Very laid back/relaxed vibe. Come hang with us.
https://discord.gg/AWFV7FT3RQ
I'm also on the imgcat server for updates & fun:
https://discord.gg/TpjD37jgJ9

***Also if you miss abbiistabbii's discord community good news! You can now find it here https://discord.gg/6nrrXJQa - where everyone's reconnecting, shitposting, and hanging out again***

Today's message from Pippin: [noncommital grunt]

______
1) Are you on the run to a safe place and passing through Arizona on your way to safer grounds?  My apartment is open to you to crash at, and it is a safe space. Pippin and I will make you a meal and gladly share tea, wine, or mead with you.

2) Hey!  Take your meds with a full glass of water, please. Do it for Pippin, or Space Mom, or better yet, do it for yourself.

3) Ĝefeloað wē. We will carry on.

4) all funds from the sales of items at these two links will be sent to support charities aiding to fight for Trans rights in the US (not just T-shirts!)
